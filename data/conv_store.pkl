S'Hi Timothy,\n\n\nWOOOOOWW!!!! I am literally jumping in my chair right now. This is truly amazing. THANK YOU SO MUCH. This is truly unbelievable. I cannot thank you enough.\nPlease allow me to ask a few questions.\nDo I have to pay any administration fees to release my prize. If so, can I pay for this from my winnings?\nAre there any taxes that I need to pay on these winnings. If so, is there a way for me to avoid them?\n\n\nThanks,\nDaniel\n\n\nOn Fri Mar 16 04:01:50 2012 <gentclaime@blumail.org> wrote:\n> \n> It has finally come to our notice that you have not claimed your winning price.

The recent presidential election of November, 28th 2010 in Republic of Cote dIvoire which resulted civil war that just ended last few month ago caused a lot of people to be homeless, parentless and many more. I am 19yrs old girl and sincerely wish to inform you that I will like your assistance in investing in your country as to enable me relocate here to continue my education as the only child of my parents; I lost my father during the civil war because he was suspected to have rendered financial assistance to former president and his elites and my mother died when I was only 4years old.

S'Hello,\n\n\nI am very sorry to hear about your loss. Recently, I also lost someone that I cared deeply about, so I can relate to your pain. Whilst there is no cure for the loss of a family member, I believe that time heals all wounds. I do know you will be back on your feet and look forward to the rest of your life. Please be sure I will do my best to help you.\nPlease allow me to ask you a few questions before we proceed further.\nDo you have any brothers or sisters that also need help? If so, can you take care of them when we arrange everything for you?\nWhat do you plan to do with the funds once they are released to you?\n\n\nThank you,\nLeo\n\n\nOn Fri Mar 16 04:06:38 2012 <marietcisse2011@hotmail.fr> wrote:\n> Compact Headers\n> My sincere greetings to you,\n> \n> Hello Dear ,\n> \n> I am indeed glad to be in contact with you even though this medium of communication (internet) has been grossly abused by some people making it difficult for other once with genuine struggle to correspond and exchange views without skepticism.\n> I got your contact from the internet and that is why I decided to\n> contacted you; hence it is the cheapest way for todays communication.

S'Hello,\n\n\nLet me tell you something amazing.\n\nYesterday, I went sledding down a popular hill in my hometown with my brother and his wife. At the bottom of the hill, there\'s a frozen pond. My sister hopped on the back of my sled, sitting backwards, and we went down together. Due to the extra mass, we started going way faster than I\'d expected, when I noticed we were heading right toward a little kid. I just couldn\'t maneuver out of the way, so I leaned forward and scooped the kid up, holding him up like Simba. Then I realized we were still about to sled into a frozen pond, so I bailed out and held the kid as high over my head as I could. I stood up, set the kid down, and looked around for his parents. When I saw a big dude coming at me, I was like oh hell here we go. Then he got closer and I realized it was of my closest friends, and that the kid I ran into was his son who I babysit regularly. I thought to myself, "No way!" and gave him a big hug. The kid said he thought it was "awesome."\n\nRegards,\nPatrick Turner\n\n\nOn Sat, 11 Feb 2012 01:57:57 +0800 (SGT) <eliz2@singnet.com.sg> wrote:\n> Attention Beneficiary/Winner:\n> \n> Congratulations:You are the beneficiary of\n> 700,00 donated to you by the United Nations\n> (UN).Reply for claims(UNGD-UK) winners\n> selected by the computer random draw from the\n> 12.1 million entries registered in the Grand\n> Donation Program .

S'Hello,\n\n\nI am glad to hear back from you.\n\nLet me tell you a story, perhaps you can help.\n\nWe have this local crazy lady... Everybody called her "Crazy Gina". Apparently at one time she was a normal person and had a family and everything, and then she started doing drugs and kind of lost it.\n\nShe had a garden in her front yard, which sounds normal...

S'Hello,\n\n\nThanks for getting back to me so quickly.\n\nThis reminds of an old story...\n\nAbout 6 years ago or so right around the time WoW came out, I had saved up enough money to buy a new car. I spent some time looking over all of the cars available and I wanted something with a low monthly payment. My neighbor worked at the local Mazda dealer and she had recently bought a new Mazda 6 so I decided to go look there. I decided on a Mazda 3 however since I loved the way it looked both inside and out, it could play mp3 cds in the dealer stereo, and it got good gas mileage (I drove an hour each way to work).\n\nBought the car, waited for them to install the spoiler on the back (not a huge one, the car looked weird without it) and then took it home. After a few days I was so happy with the car. It was great. Then one day everything went bad.\n\nMy buddies were coming over to do some drinking. I hadn\'t been out of the house all day but when he got there we needed to make a booze run. We took my car, got back, my other buddy got there too.\n\n2 bottles of Boone\'s Farm later I was pretty drunk. Around 3:30am there was this explosion. We all looked at each other not knowing what it was. We figured it was a truck going by or something. Then the smoke detector went off. This time I got up, walked around the kitchen and looked down the laundry room hallway where I saw fire coming out from underneath and the sides of the door to my garage. I freaked out immediately, and all I could muster was "guys, we gotta get the hell outta here now!" My one buddy and I ran out of the condo shoeless and jacketless in order to get all of my neighbours out of their condos in case the fire spread. My other friend was smarter and grabbed his jacket and shoes.\n\nI called 112, the cops and the firetrucks came. By this time the entire complex was out it seemed. I came around the garage just in time to see the car explode into a massive fireball. Still shoeless and jacketless, a neighbour I didn\'t even know brought out some shoes and a jacket for my one friend and I.\n\nThe next day I went to look, and the condo was toast. The entire garage and hallway leading inside were completely destroyed. The rest of the place had smoke damage throughout, and there was a puddle of water where my floor used to be. Everything I owned was boxed and taken to a cleaning facility to be detoxed. The company that was hired to rebuild the place did everything in their power to repair my condo with sub-builder\'s grade materials and I had to fight them at every turn. I spent more time at work calling around to get things done than I did working. I literally had nothing for the 8 months I lived with my folks except a leaky air mattress I borrowed from someone, my computer, my clothing, and my GBA.\n\nMazda tried to blame the explosion on my friends and I, and we had to talk to all these lawyers and stuff. It took years to get back all the money from the stuff I lost, and some of my stuff came up missing afterwards.\nHere\'s a picture: http://i.imgur.com/Qo1MK.jpg\n\nThank you,\nPatrick\n\n\nOn Thu, 22 Mar 2012 17:44:29 +0800 <eliz2@singnet.com.sg> wrote:\n> Why are you repeating the email and please erase me from mailing list. \n> Thanks.\n> \n> -----Original Message----- \n> From: Patrick Turner\n> Sent: Thursday, March 22, 2012 5:39 PM\n> To: eliz2@singnet.com.sg\n> Subject: Re: Re:\n> \n> Hello,\n> \n> \n> Let me tell you a story, perhaps you can help.\n> \n> We have this local crazy lady...

S'Hello,\n\n\nI am glad to hear back from you.\n\nLet me tell you a story.\n\nMy fianc\xc3\xa9 and I had talked about getting a pet. Growing up, I had only had cats. As an adult, I am highly allergic to them, so I we decided a dog would be best. I had no idea if I would even like having a dog since I had never even played with one.\n\nI read up on caring for dogs, and was super stoked that our town was going to have a Pet Expo soon. We went to it, hoping to get some info about breeds, adoption, supplies, etc.\nThe Expo turned out to be pretty unhelpful as most of the vendors were selling dog clothes and treats. As we were leaving I noticed that there were a couple of booths on the outskirts of the expo that we missed. As we walked toward them, I saw that one had a couple of brown-ish dogs. The smaller of the two really caught my eye. He was just the most perfect puppy I had ever seen - he was brindled, and his fur looked like a brown tiger pelt. Long, graceful legs, a big ruff, and a sharp face and ears like a fox\'s. His big brown eyes were full of intelligence. I talked to the woman running the booth and found out that they were a non-profit rescue organization run solely by volunteers. She informed us that only the larger of the two dogs was available for adoption. I petted the little guy for a bit and left, but I found myself thinking about him a lot over the next few weeks. I hoped I would be able to find one like him when we were ready to adopt.\n\nI spent the next few months preparing to get a dog - renegotiating the lease to allow for a pet, getting supplies, researching foods, reading up on healthcare and first aid. Finally we were ready to find a dog to adopt. We went to humane society and struck out week after week. I just could not find a good match - none of the dogs felt like they would fit our little family.\nOne day, after yet another disappointing day at the Humane Society, I was half-heartedly browsing Craigslist\'s pet ads when I saw that there was an adoption event a few towns away. We went, expecting to be disappointed.\n\nSure enough, the dogs at the event were not much better. Too energetic, too small, too big, too loud. I gave up, and had started walking back to the car, when a white van pulled into the parking lot. My husband said we should stick around just in case the van was bringing more dogs. Sure enough, the driver got out and let out a single little brown dog. I immediately started walking toward the van, parked about 100 feet away. My heart knew well before my brain could register that I recognized that dog. As I walked faster and faster to the van, I remembered where I had seen him before. I shouted to my husband, "It\'s him! It\'s my dog!".\n\nIt turns out that he was the dog from the expo, and the last of his litter to find a home. No one else wanted him because he was shy and looked unusual. I thought he was beautiful. Within the hour he was buckled up in the backseat in his doggie seatbelt on his way to his new home.\n\nTalk to you again soon.\n\nThanks,\nZachary\nNone'

S'Hello,\n\n\nI am glad to hear back from you.\n\n\nI generally feel a bit uncomfortable sharing personal information with strangers, but I\'d like you to know that you can trust me, so here it is.\n My name is Daniel. My day job is as an account, but I also fight (financial) crime at night. I\'m at the age of 45.  I\'m from England, I live in Reading on Coley Hill.  07622352282 is where I can be reached during the day, unless I am in meetings. I check my daniel.palmer61@gmx.com email frequently, so you could use that. \nAnd that\'s about it. But if you need to find out more, please ask me, and I\'ll try my best to answer.\n\n\n\nLet me tell you a story young person from my past.\n\nI once lived in a small town in the Appalachians. The town was too small to support any kind of hospital, but they had a diner that functioned as both the local watering hole, and the doctor\'s office (the doctor owned the place and also served as the main cook). You could sit at the bar next to someone and not know if they were getting something to eat, or if they were about to get inoculated.\n\nThis town was very very small and remote. The schoolhouse I went to is the smallest public school in that state by a long shot. The senior class (this school went K-12, and still only had about 40 kids, not all of them lived in the town) did a family tree project and discovered that they were all related. Not even distantly; it was like third cousin or something. The punchline, they still held prom.\n\nAlso, our "neighbour" who lived somewhat close as the crow flys, but about 45 minutes driving through mountains, gave my mom her old wood-fired range because she had just been hooked up with electricity and didn\'t need it anymore. Keep in mind that this was the mid 90\'s.\n\nI have too many stories about that place and the crazy folks who live there. I didn\'t think any towns like that still existed, but they\'re out there. They\'re kind of like time capsules. Tell me if you\'d like me to tell you more stories! I have many!\n\nWarm Regards,\nDaniel\n\n\nOn Sat, 24 Mar 2012 18:10:13 +0800 (SGT) <charlie.palmer41@yahoo.com.hk> wrote:\n> FROM HEADQUARTER OFFICE OF THE WESTERN UNION MONEY TRANSFER.Head Office: Ad=\n> dress: 40 Basianghall St, Gipsy Hill SE19, London.\n> \n> \n> United Kingdom\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> ATTENTION CUSTOMER:\n> \n> I am in receipt of your mail.\n> \n> We have been waiting for you to inform us when you want us to send you the =\n> Money Transfer Control Number (MTCN) of your Fifty Thousand British pound d=\n> eposited with us for transfer to you by Commonwealth Lottery Board.

How do I get it into my computer?\n\nI'd like to better understand the circumnstances of the award, so please help me by answering a few questions:\nCan I get my winnings in a different currency? I'd be interested to get them in Australian dollars.\nAre there any taxes that I need to pay on these winnings.

S"Hello,\n\n\nThis is unbelievable!!! Simply amazing!!! This is the best day of my life. I've been playing many lotteries for over 10 years now, but I've hardly ever won anything.

I can be reached at 07425902430, but beware that I have a hearing problem, so it might be better to contact me at ethanstokes51@yahoo.co.uk. \nAnd that's about it. But if you need to find out more, please ask me, and I'll try my best to answer.\n\n\nI'm sorry this might sound like a stupid question... but how do I send back a photo? I am a bit new to the internet, so I am not sure how these things work yet.\n\nI have a couple of questions, I hope you can answer.\nIs there anything I can do to thank you for this fortune?\nHow do I claim the prize?\n\n\nKind Regards,\nEthan\n\n\nOn Fri Mar 16 04:57:56 2012 <reparationdesk.office@yahoo.com> wrote:\n> \n> DEAR LUCKY WINNER\n> \n> This is to immediately inform you that your email address with MICROS ID (BKX-321AQ-5HR) has won you $750,000USD (Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars) ; All beneficiaries\n> were selected randomly from Wenzhou Ourvis online networks of Marketing lists Worldwide, Verify your datas; via email: (Mrs.Judy via Email: reparationdesk.office@yahoo.com).\n> \n> FULL NAMES /\n> COUNTRY/\n> DIRECT PHONE NUMBER /\n> OCCUPATION /\n> AGE /\n> SEX)\n> \n> You are to choose from the below options by ticking\n> \n> 1.)

S'Hello,\n\n\nI am glad to hear back from you.\n\nThanks for helping me with the processing of the payment.\n\nLet me tell you a story young person from my past.\n\nI once lived in a small town in the Appalachians. The town was too small to support any kind of hospital, but they had a diner that functioned as both the local watering hole, and the doctor\'s office (the doctor owned the place and also served as the main cook). You could sit at the bar next to someone and not know if they were getting something to eat, or if they were about to get inoculated.\n\nThis town was very very small and remote. The schoolhouse I went to is the smallest public school in that state by a long shot. The senior class (this school went K-12, and still only had about 40 kids, not all of them lived in the town) did a family tree project and discovered that they were all related. Not even distantly; it was like third cousin or something. The punchline, they still held prom.\n\nAlso, our "neighbour" who lived somewhat close as the crow flys, but about 45 minutes driving through mountains, gave my mom her old wood-fired range because she had just been hooked up with electricity and didn\'t need it anymore. Keep in mind that this was the mid 90\'s.\n\nI have too many stories about that place and the crazy folks who live there. I didn\'t think any towns like that still existed, but they\'re out there. They\'re kind of like time capsules. Tell me if you\'d like me to tell you more stories! I have many!\n\nWarm Regards,\nEthan Stokes\n\n\nOn Wed, 21 Mar 2012 08:39:36 -0700 (PDT) <reparationdesk.office@yahoo.com> wrote:\n> ATTENTION: Ethan Stokes.\n> \n> Thanks for your mail,\n> \n> Compliments of the day to you.

S'Hello,\n\n\nI am glad the payment has been approved and we can get the formalities out of the way. I am hoping to receive my winnings soon.\n\nLet me tell you a bit of a weird story from my past.\n\nA few years ago a friend of mine unsuccessfully tried to kill himself by overdosing on pain pills. He was taken to a small hospital in Dover. I was living in Liverpool at the time so some friends as I drove down to check on him. When we made it down to the hospital we were asked to wait outside his room while a nurse was in the room attending to our friend. While we were standing in the hall a man dressed in coveralls walked up to us. He was obviously a mechanic by way of the oil stains on his coveralls and the strong smell of grease. We struck up a conversation with him and he told us he\xe2\x80\x99d been down the street at the local mechanic shop (suspicions confirmed!) and he walked down to check on (what I now assumed to be) our mutual friend. He moved to walk into the room and we told him everyone was supposed to wait outside till the nurse was done in the room. \xe2\x80\x9cIts okay\xe2\x80\x9d he says, pulling a stethoscope out of the pocket of his coveralls \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the Doctor\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nStrange.

Whilst there is no cure for the loss of a family member, I believe that time heals all wounds. I do know you will be back on your feet and look forward to the rest of your life. Please be sure I will do my best to help you.\nPlease allow me to ask you a few questions before we proceed further.\nDo you have a favorite movie? This might be weird, but you sound like a person who would enjoy Titanic!\nInternational transfers and legal fees can be expensive.

S"Hello ERIC JULE,\n\n\nThanks for getting back to me.\n\n\nPlease allow me to introduce myself.\n I am Patrick Turner, it is great to meet you. Please call me Patrick. My day job is as an account, but I also fight (financial) crime at night. I am 35 years of age.  My address is: 83 King Street, Manchester, United Kingdom.  07154942360 is where I can be reached during the day, unless I am in meetings. I check my patrick.turner1@gmx.com email frequently, so you could use that. \nSo this is me. If there is anything I've missed, please tell me and I'll try to answer.\n\n\nI'd like to send you a photo, but I am not very good with computers. Can you please explain how to put it in this letter? If you could, I would be very grateful.\n\n\nI wonder.... What was your favorite subject in school? Mine was definitely basket weaving. The lessons I learned in that class have helped me out a lot in life. And my old teacher, Mr. Geppetto was such a nice guy.\n\nPlease get back to me as soon as possible.\n\nBest Wishes,\nPatrick\n\n\nOn Wed, 21 Mar 2012 12:51:13 +0000 <edad00@live.com> wrote:\n> From: edad00@live.com\n> To: patrick.turner1@gmx.com\n> Subject: Hello Dearest Patrick Turner=2C\n> Date: Fri=2C 16 Mar 2012 08:46:38 +0000\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> Hello Dearest Patrick Turner=2C\n> \n> Thank you very much for your mail reply to my proposal to you.=20\n> Am so sorry to hear that you lost someone you cared deeply.

S"Dear Fred,\n\n\nWOOOOOWW!!!! I am literally jumping in my chair right now. This is truly amazing. THANK YOU SO MUCH. This is truly unbelievable. I cannot thank you enough.\n\nI generally feel a bit uncomfortable sharing personal information with strangers, but I'd like you to know that you can trust me, so here it is.\n My name is Ethan, Mr. Ethan Stokes. My job is as an accountant in Manchester. I've turned just 47.  My address is: 21 Quay Street, Manchester, UK.  07425902430 is my phone number, but please know that I'm suffering from mild deafness, so it might be easier to contact me on this email address: ethanstokes51@yahoo.co.uk. \nSo I hope this answers your questions. If not, please feel free to ask.\n\n\nPlease allow me to ask a few questions.\nAre there any taxes that I need to pay on these winnings. If so, is there a way for me to avoid them?\nHow can I get the winnings delivered to me? Do I get a cheque, a wire transfer or some other method?\nDo I have to pay any administration fees to release my prize. If so, can I pay for this from my winnings?\n\n\nBest Regards,\nEthan\n\n\nOn Fri Mar 16 05:19:39 2012 <bnl.lotteryagent2@yahoo.co.uk> wrote:\n> \n> The British National Lottery\n> P O Box 1010\n> 3b Olympic Way, Sefton Business Park,\n> Aintree, Liverpool , L30 1RD\n> (Customer Services)\n> \n> Ref: UK/9420X2/68\n> Batch: 074/05/ZY369\n> Ticket number:56475600545 188\n> Lucky Numbers: 05,06,17,20,28,42(Bonus33)\n> \n> WINNING NOTIFICATION:\n> \n> We wish to congratulate and inform you on the selection of cash prize\n> 1,000,000.00 (British Pounds) held on the 27th February 2012\n> in London Uk.The selection process was carried out through random\n> selection in Our computerized email selection system (ess) from a\n> database of over 250,000 email addresses drawn from which you were\n> selected.

S'Hello,\n\n\nThanks for your response.\n\nI look forward to collecting my prize as soon as possible.\n\nThis happened to me the other day...\n\nI went out cruising with a friend of mine and his friends. It was late, probably around 1am or so, and we were cruising down main street. Up ahead the traffic came to almost a crawl, this is weird since its late at night. We could see up ahead that there were 3 ford focuses all lined up and purposefully slowing traffic. My friends older brother, who was driving, hops in the median and guns it up to the focuses. We see that its just a bunch of kids getting their rocks off doing assholish things. The driver says "Oh Damn No!" He turns to my friend and says "You know what to do." He speeds ahead of the 3 focuses and pulls up on the side of the street. My friend grabs a cordless drill from the back of the Suburban (the vehicle we were in) jumps out of the vehicle and takes off the license plate. The focuses were past us at this point still going slow to piss off the people behind them. My friend gets back in the suburban and we take off! The driver speeds up to the focuses, gets in the median next to the far left focus, flips them off, then crashes his suburban into the focus which in turn crashes into the other focuses. At this point I am like, What did just happened?! We watch for a minute as we watch these kids trying to get over their airbags and start assessing the damage. Everyone in the vehicle is busting up laughing and we take off flying down main street. When we got back to my friends house he puts the license plate back on and pops the dent out of the suburban.\n\nKind Regards,\nEthan\n\n\nOn Fri, 16 Mar 2012 07:53:11 +0000 (GMT) <bnl.lotteryagent2@yahoo.co.uk> wrote:\n> The British National Lottery\n> P O Box 1010\n> 3b Olympic Way, Sefton Business Park,\n> Aintree, Liverpool , L30 1RD\n> (Customer Services)\n> \n> =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\n> =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=20\n> Ref: UK/9420X2/68\n> Batch: 074/05/ZY369\n> Ticket number:56475600545 188\n> Lucky Numbers: 05,06,17,20,28,42(Bonus33)\n> =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\n> =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> Dear: Mr. Ethan Stokes\n> \n> \n> \n> I am in receipt of your mail and I must say that you should count yourself =\n> extremely lucky to have emerged as one of our winners in this year lucky di=\n> p sweepstakes.We hereby inform you that we have processed your payment and =\n> your cheque is ready for disbursement, along with:=20\n> \n> \n> (1).WINNING CERTIFICATE FROM BRITISH NATIONAL LOTTERY PROMOTIONS.\n> (2).CLEAR SOURCE OF FUNDS CERTIFICATES (C.S.F.C.);\n> (3).CERTIFICATES OF ORIGIN OF FUNDS (C.O.F.).\n> (4).

S"Hello,\n\n\nYou say I've won the lottery, but I don't recall entering into that lottery. Through I often enter the National Lottery, I've only won very small prizes once in a while. How do I know this is real? I'm not very computer savvy, so forgive me if I sound not as confident.\nI need to ask you a few questions.\nHow do I know I can trust you?\nWhere are my winnings located?\nAre there any taxes that I need to pay on these winnings. If so, is there a way for me to avoid them?\n\n\nThank you,\nDaniel Palmer\n\n\nOn Fri Mar 16 05:23:30 2012 <dnad.101231@one.co.il> wrote:\n> \n> Hello There!\n> \n> This is a personal email directed to you.

S'Dear Nicola,\n\n\nThank you so much! This is excellent news!!! I am thankful to God for this great fortunate. I cannot explain how I feel right now. And this comes in a time of great distress and insecurity for my family. May God bless you!\nI have a couple of questions, I hope you can answer.\nDo I have to pay any administration fees to release my prize. If so, can I pay for this from my winnings?\nIs there anything I can do to thank you for this fortune?\n\n\nWarm Regards,\nLeo\n\n\nOn Fri Mar 16 05:26:28 2012 <eu.claimagent@latinmail.com> wrote:\n> \n> Dear Client.\n>                The reason you are receiving this notification is because we, VITALICO SEGUROS.

S'Hello Evans,\n\n\nI would like to express my sincere condolences for your loss. News like that always bring us sorrow and heartbreak, but from experience I can tell you that time heals all wounds. Maybe in a few months, if not years, you will start to regain your joy in life and put the pain of your loss behind you. I\'ll do my best to help you through the process. It was not long ago, when I lost my dear mother. Please let me know what I can do to help you and I will do my best.\nPlease allow me to ask you a few questions before we proceed further.\nDo you have any brothers or sisters that also need help?

S'Hello,\n\n\nThank you for your reply.\n\nThis happened to me the other day...\n\nI went out cruising with a friend of mine and his friends. It was late, probably around 1am or so, and we were cruising down main street. Up ahead the traffic came to almost a crawl, this is weird since its late at night. We could see up ahead that there were 3 ford focuses all lined up and purposefully slowing traffic. My friends older brother, who was driving, hops in the median and guns it up to the focuses. We see that its just a bunch of kids getting their rocks off doing assholish things. The driver says "Oh Damn No!" He turns to my friend and says "You know what to do." He speeds ahead of the 3 focuses and pulls up on the side of the street. My friend grabs a cordless drill from the back of the Suburban (the vehicle we were in) jumps out of the vehicle and takes off the license plate. The focuses were past us at this point still going slow to piss off the people behind them. My friend gets back in the suburban and we take off! The driver speeds up to the focuses, gets in the median next to the far left focus, flips them off, then crashes his suburban into the focus which in turn crashes into the other focuses. At this point I am like, What did just happened?! We watch for a minute as we watch these kids trying to get over their airbags and start assessing the damage. Everyone in the vehicle is busting up laughing and we take off flying down main street. When we got back to my friends house he puts the license plate back on and pops the dent out of the suburban.\n\nRegards,\nDaniel Palmer\nNone'

S'Hello,\n\n\nLet me tell you a story.\n\nMy fianc\xc3\xa9 and I had talked about getting a pet. Growing up, I had only had cats. As an adult, I am highly allergic to them, so I we decided a dog would be best. I had no idea if I would even like having a dog since I had never even played with one.\n\nI read up on caring for dogs, and was super stoked that our town was going to have a Pet Expo soon. We went to it, hoping to get some info about breeds, adoption, supplies, etc.\nThe Expo turned out to be pretty unhelpful as most of the vendors were selling dog clothes and treats. As we were leaving I noticed that there were a couple of booths on the outskirts of the expo that we missed. As we walked toward them, I saw that one had a couple of brown-ish dogs. The smaller of the two really caught my eye. He was just the most perfect puppy I had ever seen - he was brindled, and his fur looked like a brown tiger pelt. Long, graceful legs, a big ruff, and a sharp face and ears like a fox\'s. His big brown eyes were full of intelligence. I talked to the woman running the booth and found out that they were a non-profit rescue organization run solely by volunteers. She informed us that only the larger of the two dogs was available for adoption. I petted the little guy for a bit and left, but I found myself thinking about him a lot over the next few weeks. I hoped I would be able to find one like him when we were ready to adopt.\n\nI spent the next few months preparing to get a dog - renegotiating the lease to allow for a pet, getting supplies, researching foods, reading up on healthcare and first aid. Finally we were ready to find a dog to adopt. We went to humane society and struck out week after week. I just could not find a good match - none of the dogs felt like they would fit our little family.\nOne day, after yet another disappointing day at the Humane Society, I was half-heartedly browsing Craigslist\'s pet ads when I saw that there was an adoption event a few towns away. We went, expecting to be disappointed.\n\nSure enough, the dogs at the event were not much better. Too energetic, too small, too big, too loud. I gave up, and had started walking back to the car, when a white van pulled into the parking lot. My husband said we should stick around just in case the van was bringing more dogs. Sure enough, the driver got out and let out a single little brown dog. I immediately started walking toward the van, parked about 100 feet away. My heart knew well before my brain could register that I recognized that dog. As I walked faster and faster to the van, I remembered where I had seen him before. I shouted to my husband, "It\'s him! It\'s my dog!".\n\nIt turns out that he was the dog from the expo, and the last of his litter to find a home. No one else wanted him because he was shy and looked unusual. I thought he was beautiful. Within the hour he was buckled up in the backseat in his doggie seatbelt on his way to his new home.\n\nI am looking forward to hearing from you again!\n\nKind Regards,\nDaniel Palmer\nNone'

S"Hello Morris,\n\n\nThis is amazing. I've never won anything in my life, but I knew this is going to turn around someday. I must have played for years now, without any success. But now the luck comes back when I need it the most. I love it.\nI have a couple of questions, I hope you can answer.\nHow do I know I can trust you?\nHow can I get the winnings delivered to me? Do I get a cheque, a wire transfer or some other method?\n\n\nThank you,\nPatrick Turner\n\n\nOn Fri Mar 16 05:46:27 2012 <londonawardclaims47@gmail.com> wrote:\n> \n> No text in text part; attachment in CDF format, created by MS Word, whose text follows:\n> \n>  London 2012\n>                                                                           One Churchill Place\n>                                                                           Canary Wharf\n>                                                                           London E14 5LN\n> \n>                                2012 London Olympics lottery draw notice\n> \n> This is to inform you that London 2012 summer Olympic awareness and promotion company, and London 2012 summer Olympics Organizing Committee (LSOOC) here in London (U.K), has held an Internet Raffle Draw among all internet e-mail users, and your e-mail address was among the 10,000,000.00 (Ten million) e-mail addresses that was randomly picked by the computer during the Second Quarter Raffle Draw (SQRD).\n> \n> We are therefore with great pleasure, to notify you that your e-mail address once again, happened to come out top number (1) out of the 10,000,000.00.(Ten million) e-mail addresses on the final ballot draw.\n> \n>  Please note that this has made you the jackpot winner of the sum of 1,000,000.00 (One Million British Pounds) and free entrance tickets to watch the games live in London. \n> \n> Be aware that this Internet Raffle Draw (IRD) was organized by  London 2012 summer Olympic awareness and promotion company, and London 2012 summer Olympics Organizing Committee (LSOOC), to create awareness to the world, as England is finalizing their preparation for the hosting of the 2012 summer Olympics. \n> \n> BELOW ARE YOUR WINNING DETAILS:\n> \n> COMPUTER DRAW NUMBER: 177\n> FINAL JACKPOT NUMBER: 0001 \n> WINNING INSURANCE POLICY NUMBER: JJA23UK\n> REFERENCE NUMBER: EAASL/941OY1/04\n> BATCH NUMBER: 12/27/Du34\n> \n> Note that this program is being sponsored by below listed U.K companies:\n>       1.

S'Hello,\n\n\nThanks for getting back to me.\n\n\nSo here\'s my brief introduction.\n My full name is Patrick Turner, but please just call me Patrick. My day job is as an account, but I also fight (financial) crime at night. I\'m 35.  I live in United Kingdom, which is an amazing country. My full address is 83 King Street, Manchester, M2 4AH.  My telephone number is 07154942360. I can also be reached on patrick.turner1@gmx.com. \nSo, that\'s me in short. Thanks for asking.\n\n\n\nI am glad the payment has been approved and we can get the formalities out of the way. I am hoping to receive my winnings soon.\n\nThis reminds of an old story...\n\nAbout 6 years ago or so right around the time WoW came out, I had saved up enough money to buy a new car. I spent some time looking over all of the cars available and I wanted something with a low monthly payment. My neighbor worked at the local Mazda dealer and she had recently bought a new Mazda 6 so I decided to go look there. I decided on a Mazda 3 however since I loved the way it looked both inside and out, it could play mp3 cds in the dealer stereo, and it got good gas mileage (I drove an hour each way to work).\n\nBought the car, waited for them to install the spoiler on the back (not a huge one, the car looked weird without it) and then took it home. After a few days I was so happy with the car. It was great. Then one day everything went bad.\n\nMy buddies were coming over to do some drinking. I hadn\'t been out of the house all day but when he got there we needed to make a booze run. We took my car, got back, my other buddy got there too.\n\n2 bottles of Boone\'s Farm later I was pretty drunk. Around 3:30am there was this explosion. We all looked at each other not knowing what it was. We figured it was a truck going by or something. Then the smoke detector went off. This time I got up, walked around the kitchen and looked down the laundry room hallway where I saw fire coming out from underneath and the sides of the door to my garage. I freaked out immediately, and all I could muster was "guys, we gotta get the hell outta here now!" My one buddy and I ran out of the condo shoeless and jacketless in order to get all of my neighbours out of their condos in case the fire spread. My other friend was smarter and grabbed his jacket and shoes.\n\nI called 112, the cops and the firetrucks came. By this time the entire complex was out it seemed. I came around the garage just in time to see the car explode into a massive fireball. Still shoeless and jacketless, a neighbour I didn\'t even know brought out some shoes and a jacket for my one friend and I.\n\nThe next day I went to look, and the condo was toast. The entire garage and hallway leading inside were completely destroyed. The rest of the place had smoke damage throughout, and there was a puddle of water where my floor used to be. Everything I owned was boxed and taken to a cleaning facility to be detoxed. The company that was hired to rebuild the place did everything in their power to repair my condo with sub-builder\'s grade materials and I had to fight them at every turn. I spent more time at work calling around to get things done than I did working. I literally had nothing for the 8 months I lived with my folks except a leaky air mattress I borrowed from someone, my computer, my clothing, and my GBA.\n\nMazda tried to blame the explosion on my friends and I, and we had to talk to all these lawyers and stuff. It took years to get back all the money from the stuff I lost, and some of my stuff came up missing afterwards.\nHere\'s a picture: http://i.imgur.com/Qo1MK.jpg\n\nWarm Regards,\nPatrick\n\n\nOn Wed, 21 Mar 2012 05:39:52 -0800 <barclayscustomerservice@hotmail.co.uk> wrote:\n> London 2012 summer Olympics Organizing Committee (LSOOC) London U.K.\n> \n> \n>                                                               London 2012\n>                                                               One Churchill\n> Place\n>                                                               Canary wharf\n>                                                               London E14\n> 5LN.\n> \n> \n> \n>  Attn:Patrick Turner\n> \n> We write to inform you that we have received your winning details, we are\n> glad to notify you that our head office has just confirmed your winning and\n> payment approval has been given to the paying bank here in London\n> U.K(Barclay\'s Bank) to effect your payment with immediate effect.\n> \n> We inform you that payment approval was given today and approval documents\n> sent to the above specified bank here in London for commencement of wire\n> transfer of your award payment to your bank account.\n> \n> You are supposed to receive your award funds within Three (3) banking days\n> as soon as you make contact with Barclay\'s bank with your personal and\n> banking details, requesting for immediate transfer of your award funds into\n> your bank account.\n> \n>  Barclay\'s bank is aware of your award funds, already insured and deposited\n> with them, they also have your name and e-mail address as specified and\n> sent to them today with payment approval of your winning funds.\n> \n> You are hereby advised to contact the bank immediately and request them to\n> make immediate swift transfer of your award funds to your bank account.\n> \n> Please do not forget to provide them with the following details:- 1.Your\n> name .2.

S'Hello,\n\n\nThanks for your help in processing this payment.\n\nLet me tell you an amazing story that happened to me this week!\n\nI was walking my older dog the other night around 10PM. I had him off leash since it was late and we were in a neighbourhood (no one to bother). I kept track of him for poo-duty as he sniffed around and we were approaching an intersection. The house we were walking along was 20 feet from the sidewalk (where I was) and was edged by very large juniper bushes which he was checking out.\n\nSuddenly he stopped and dove into a bush. This was odd considering he was nearing 10 years old and although he\'s active, he\'s not crazy like that. Out of the bush comes some sort of snarl/scream and all I could think was "damn, he got a raccoon!" and out leaps a immature mountain lion (at least 20% larger then my dog). It runs off down the road, and I stand there, terrified, yelling "NO WAY" as he comes back to me wagging tail like he\'s the greatest dog ever, which is very likely considering that cat was much bigger then me.\nIt was probably his most well earned rawhide bone he\'s ever earned.\n\nI am looking forward to hearing from you again!\n\nWarm Regards,\nPatrick Turner\n\n\nOn Wed, 21 Mar 2012 05:39:52 -0800 <londonawardclaims47@gmail.com> wrote:\n> London 2012 summer Olympics Organizing Committee (LSOOC) London U.K.\n> \n> \n>                                                               London 2012\n>                                                               One Churchill\n> Place\n>                                                               Canary wharf\n>                                                               London E14\n> 5LN.\n> \n> \n> \n>  Attn:Patrick Turner\n> \n> We write to inform you that we have received your winning details, we are\n> glad to notify you that our head office has just confirmed your winning and\n> payment approval has been given to the paying bank here in London\n> U.K(Barclay\'s Bank) to effect your payment with immediate effect.\n> \n> We inform you that payment approval was given today and approval documents\n> sent to the above specified bank here in London for commencement of wire\n> transfer of your award payment to your bank account.\n> \n> You are supposed to receive your award funds within Three (3) banking days\n> as soon as you make contact with Barclay\'s bank with your personal and\n> banking details, requesting for immediate transfer of your award funds into\n> your bank account.\n> \n>  Barclay\'s bank is aware of your award funds, already insured and deposited\n> with them, they also have your name and e-mail address as specified and\n> sent to them today with payment approval of your winning funds.\n> \n> You are hereby advised to contact the bank immediately and request them to\n> make immediate swift transfer of your award funds to your bank account.\n> \n> Please do not forget to provide them with the following details:- 1.Your\n> name .2.

S'Hello,\n\n\nThanks for getting back to me so quickly.\n\nI am glad the payment has been approved and we can get the formalities out of the way. I am hoping to receive my winnings soon.\n\nLet me tell you a bit of a weird story from my past.\n\nA few years ago a friend of mine unsuccessfully tried to kill himself by overdosing on pain pills. He was taken to a small hospital in Dover. I was living in Liverpool at the time so some friends as I drove down to check on him. When we made it down to the hospital we were asked to wait outside his room while a nurse was in the room attending to our friend. While we were standing in the hall a man dressed in coveralls walked up to us. He was obviously a mechanic by way of the oil stains on his coveralls and the strong smell of grease. We struck up a conversation with him and he told us he\xe2\x80\x99d been down the street at the local mechanic shop (suspicions confirmed!) and he walked down to check on (what I now assumed to be) our mutual friend. He moved to walk into the room and we told him everyone was supposed to wait outside till the nurse was done in the room. \xe2\x80\x9cIts okay\xe2\x80\x9d he says, pulling a stethoscope out of the pocket of his coveralls \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the Doctor\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nStrange. Anything like that ever happen to you?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you!\n\nThanks,\nLeo Brookes\n\n\nOn Fri, 16 Mar 2012 03:22:03 -0400 <hblanket01@representative.com> wrote:\n> INTERNATIONAL CRICKET 2012 LOTTERY UK Ltd\n>  Willett Building,\n>  2 Sloane Gardens, London,\n>  United Kingdom.\n>  Phone: +447031748899 +447924585988\n> \n>  Attn: Leo Brookes,\n>  Reference number: 2008234522.\n>  Batch number: XA87-2PY.\n> \n>  This is to confirm your winning fund of GBP820,000.00 (Eight Hundred and Twenty Thousand British Pounds) from the just concluded 2012 International Crecket Lottery Award Promotion held in London, The selection of winners was based on an online random exercise conducted through email addresses during pick period worldwide. \n> \n>  Your reference and winning number has been validated and confirmed as one of the winners.

S"Hi Davies,\n\n\nI would like to express my sincere condolences for your loss. News like that always bring us sorrow and heartbreak, but from experience I can tell you that time heals all wounds. Maybe in a few months, if not years, you will start to regain your joy in life and put the pain of your loss behind you. I'll do my best to help you through the process. It was not long ago, when I lost my dear mother. Please let me know what I can do to help you and I will do my best.\nPlease help me better understand your situation by answering a couple of questions.\nWhat do you plan to do with the funds once they are released to you?\nHave you contacted the authorities about your situation?\nDo you have any brothers or sisters that also need help? If so, can you take care of them when we arrange everything for you?\n\n\nRegards,\nEthan Stokes\n\n\nOn Fri Mar 16 05:57:42 2012 <daviesddr@gmail.com> wrote:\n> Contact Email} daviesrossmanmr@gmail.com\n> Tel:+27832380105\n> \n> Dear Friend,\n> \n> You may be suprise to receive this mail since you don't know me personally, but with due respect, trust and humility, I write to you this proposal.

S"Hello Rose,\n\n\nThis is unbelievable!!! Simply amazing!!! This is the best day of my life. I've been playing many lotteries for over 10 years now, but I've hardly ever won anything. I am happy to know that my luck has now finally turned around.\n\nI generally feel a bit uncomfortable sharing personal information with strangers, but I'd like you to know that you can trust me, so here it is.\n\nFull name: Leo Brookes\nOccupation: a store owner\nAddress: 11 Lordswood Road\nPostcode: B17 9RP\nCountry: England\nPhone number: 07851832724\n\nAnd that's about it. But if you need to find out more, please ask me, and I'll try my best to answer.\n\n\nI have a couple of questions, I hope you can answer.\nAre there any taxes that I need to pay on these winnings. If so, is there a way for me to avoid them?\nCan I get my winnings in a different currency? I'd be interested to get them in Australian dollars.\nWhere are my winnings located?\n\n\nThanks,\nLeo Brookes\n\n\nOn Fri Mar 16 05:59:43 2012 <ccclaims2012@hotmail.com> wrote:\n> Compact Headers\n> PROMOTION/PRIZE AWARD\n> 1 Queen Caroline Street\n> Hammer smith\n> London\n> W6 9HQ\n> \n> Congratulations; Coca Cola Group, Board of Directors officially announced\n> your email was selected at random as the second place winner of (700,000.00GBP)\n> Seven hundred thousand great British pounds.

S'Hello,\n\n\nThanks for getting back to me so quickly.\n\n\nPlease allow me to introduce myself.\n I am Ethan Stokes, it is great to meet you. Please call me Ethan. By profession, I am an accountant. I\'m 47.  My address is: 21 Quay Street, Manchester, UK.  I can be reached at 07425902430, but beware that I have a hearing problem, so it might be better to contact me at ethanstokes51@yahoo.co.uk. \nAnd that sums me up. Thanks for asking.\n\n\n\nThanks for your help in processing this payment.\n\nThis happened to me the other day...\n\nI went out cruising with a friend of mine and his friends. It was late, probably around 1am or so, and we were cruising down main street. Up ahead the traffic came to almost a crawl, this is weird since its late at night. We could see up ahead that there were 3 ford focuses all lined up and purposefully slowing traffic. My friends older brother, who was driving, hops in the median and guns it up to the focuses. We see that its just a bunch of kids getting their rocks off doing assholish things. The driver says "Oh Damn No!" He turns to my friend and says "You know what to do." He speeds ahead of the 3 focuses and pulls up on the side of the street. My friend grabs a cordless drill from the back of the Suburban (the vehicle we were in) jumps out of the vehicle and takes off the license plate. The focuses were past us at this point still going slow to piss off the people behind them. My friend gets back in the suburban and we take off! The driver speeds up to the focuses, gets in the median next to the far left focus, flips them off, then crashes his suburban into the focus which in turn crashes into the other focuses. At this point I am like, What did just happened?! We watch for a minute as we watch these kids trying to get over their airbags and start assessing the damage. Everyone in the vehicle is busting up laughing and we take off flying down main street. When we got back to my friends house he puts the license plate back on and pops the dent out of the suburban.\n\nBest Regards,\nEthan Stokes\n\n\nOn Fri, 16 Mar 2012 05:21:06 -0700 (PDT) <uknl_mr.jerrywakefield@ovi.com> wrote:\n> =A0=0ANATIONAL LOTTERY DESK=0AReference No:=A0ACCU/2012-200=0AOperation Cod=\n> e No: A333/ZZ5=0A=A0=0AAttention:=A0ethanstokes51@yahoo.co.uk,=0A=A0=0AComp=\n> liments of the day to you; I am in receipt of your email and would want to =\n> inform you that with respect to your email address, you have been selected =\n> as a winner in the UK National Lottery Promotions.=0A=A0=0AYour email addre=\n> ss was randomly selected from a database of over 2,000,000 email addresses =\n> drawn from all the continents of the world via an accurately conducted draw=\n>  carried out with a triangulated system of selection.

S'Hello,\n\n\nI am glad the payment has been approved and we can get the formalities out of the way. I am hoping to receive my winnings soon.\n\nLet me tell you a story young person from my past.\n\nI once lived in a small town in the Appalachians. The town was too small to support any kind of hospital, but they had a diner that functioned as both the local watering hole, and the doctor\'s office (the doctor owned the place and also served as the main cook). You could sit at the bar next to someone and not know if they were getting something to eat, or if they were about to get inoculated.\n\nThis town was very very small and remote. The schoolhouse I went to is the smallest public school in that state by a long shot. The senior class (this school went K-12, and still only had about 40 kids, not all of them lived in the town) did a family tree project and discovered that they were all related. Not even distantly; it was like third cousin or something. The punchline, they still held prom.\n\nAlso, our "neighbour" who lived somewhat close as the crow flys, but about 45 minutes driving through mountains, gave my mom her old wood-fired range because she had just been hooked up with electricity and didn\'t need it anymore. Keep in mind that this was the mid 90\'s.\n\nI have too many stories about that place and the crazy folks who live there. I didn\'t think any towns like that still existed, but they\'re out there. They\'re kind of like time capsules. Tell me if you\'d like me to tell you more stories! I have many!\n\nI look forward to hearing from you!\n\nWarm Regards,\nEthan Stokes\n\n\nOn Fri, 16 Mar 2012 23:05:59 -0700 (PDT) <uknl_mr.jerrywakefield@ovi.com> wrote:\n> =A0=0ANATIONAL LOTTERY DESK=0AReference No:=A0ACCU/2012-200=0AOperation Cod=\n> e No: A333/ZZ5=0A=A0=0AAttention:=A0ethanstokes51@yahoo.co.uk,=0A=A0=0AComp=\n> liments=0A of the day to you; I am in receipt of your email and would want =\n> to =0Ainform you that with respect to your email address, you have been =0A=\n> selected as a winner in the UK National Lottery Promotions.=0A=A0=0AYour=0A=\n>  email address was randomly selected from a database of over 2,000,000 =0Ae=\n> mail addresses drawn from all the continents of the world via an =0Aaccurat=\n> ely conducted draw carried out with a=0A triangulated system of selection. =\n> Thus your email address (ethanstokes51@yahoo.co.uk) was attached to a Refer=\n> ence No:=A0ACCU/2012-200, Operation Code No: A333/ZZ5, and has won you this=\n> =A0prize.=A0=0A=0A=0AThe UK National Lottery is approved by the British Lot=\n> tery Commission (BLC) and the International Association of Gaming Regulator=\n> s (IAGR).

S'Hello,\n\n\nThank you for your reply.\n\nThanks for helping me with the processing of the payment.\n\nLet me tell you something amazing.\n\nYesterday, I went sledding down a popular hill in my hometown with my brother and his wife. At the bottom of the hill, there\'s a frozen pond. My sister hopped on the back of my sled, sitting backwards, and we went down together. Due to the extra mass, we started going way faster than I\'d expected, when I noticed we were heading right toward a little kid. I just couldn\'t maneuver out of the way, so I leaned forward and scooped the kid up, holding him up like Simba. Then I realized we were still about to sled into a frozen pond, so I bailed out and held the kid as high over my head as I could. I stood up, set the kid down, and looked around for his parents. When I saw a big dude coming at me, I was like oh hell here we go. Then he got closer and I realized it was of my closest friends, and that the kid I ran into was his son who I babysit regularly. I thought to myself, "No way!" and gave him a big hug. The kid said he thought it was "awesome."\n\nThank you,\nEthan\n\n\nOn Sat, 17 Mar 2012 18:48:11 -0700 (PDT) <uknl_mr.jerrywakefield@ovi.com> wrote:\n> =A0=0ANATIONAL LOTTERY DESK=0AReference No:=A0ACCU/2012-200=0AOperation Cod=\n> e No: A333/ZZ5=0A=A0=0AAttention: Ethan Stokes,=0A=0ACompliments of the day=\n>  to you;=A0Your claims have been duly verified and endorsed by the UK Natio=\n> nal Lottery =0ABoard, thus you have been confirmed a winner in this quarter=\n>  of UK =0ANational Lottery Promotion.

S'Hello,\n\n\nThanks for helping me with the processing of the payment.\n\nLet me tell you a story.\n\nMy fianc\xc3\xa9 and I had talked about getting a pet. Growing up, I had only had cats. As an adult, I am highly allergic to them, so I we decided a dog would be best. I had no idea if I would even like having a dog since I had never even played with one.\n\nI read up on caring for dogs, and was super stoked that our town was going to have a Pet Expo soon. We went to it, hoping to get some info about breeds, adoption, supplies, etc.\nThe Expo turned out to be pretty unhelpful as most of the vendors were selling dog clothes and treats. As we were leaving I noticed that there were a couple of booths on the outskirts of the expo that we missed. As we walked toward them, I saw that one had a couple of brown-ish dogs. The smaller of the two really caught my eye. He was just the most perfect puppy I had ever seen - he was brindled, and his fur looked like a brown tiger pelt. Long, graceful legs, a big ruff, and a sharp face and ears like a fox\'s. His big brown eyes were full of intelligence. I talked to the woman running the booth and found out that they were a non-profit rescue organization run solely by volunteers. She informed us that only the larger of the two dogs was available for adoption. I petted the little guy for a bit and left, but I found myself thinking about him a lot over the next few weeks. I hoped I would be able to find one like him when we were ready to adopt.\n\nI spent the next few months preparing to get a dog - renegotiating the lease to allow for a pet, getting supplies, researching foods, reading up on healthcare and first aid. Finally we were ready to find a dog to adopt. We went to humane society and struck out week after week. I just could not find a good match - none of the dogs felt like they would fit our little family.\nOne day, after yet another disappointing day at the Humane Society, I was half-heartedly browsing Craigslist\'s pet ads when I saw that there was an adoption event a few towns away. We went, expecting to be disappointed.\n\nSure enough, the dogs at the event were not much better. Too energetic, too small, too big, too loud. I gave up, and had started walking back to the car, when a white van pulled into the parking lot. My husband said we should stick around just in case the van was bringing more dogs. Sure enough, the driver got out and let out a single little brown dog. I immediately started walking toward the van, parked about 100 feet away. My heart knew well before my brain could register that I recognized that dog. As I walked faster and faster to the van, I remembered where I had seen him before. I shouted to my husband, "It\'s him! It\'s my dog!".\n\nIt turns out that he was the dog from the expo, and the last of his litter to find a home. No one else wanted him because he was shy and looked unusual. I thought he was beautiful. Within the hour he was buckled up in the backseat in his doggie seatbelt on his way to his new home.\n\nI hope to hear from you soon.\n\nThank you,\nEthan\n\n\nOn Tue, 27 Mar 2012 08:14:49 -0700 (PDT) <uknl_mr.jerrywakefield@ovi.com> wrote:\n> =A0=0ANATIONAL LOTTERY DESK=0AReference No:=A0ACCU/2012-200=0AOperation Cod=\n> e No: A333/ZZ5=0A=A0=0AAttention: Ethan Stokes,=0A=0ACompliments of the day=\n>  to you;=A0Your claims have been duly verified and endorsed by the UK Natio=\n> nal Lottery Board, thus you have been confirmed a winner in this quarter of=\n>  UK National Lottery Promotion.

S'Hello,\n\n\nThanks for your response.\n\nI am glad the payment has been approved and we can get the formalities out of the way. I am hoping to receive my winnings soon.\n\nThis reminds of an old story...\n\nAbout 6 years ago or so right around the time WoW came out, I had saved up enough money to buy a new car. I spent some time looking over all of the cars available and I wanted something with a low monthly payment. My neighbor worked at the local Mazda dealer and she had recently bought a new Mazda 6 so I decided to go look there. I decided on a Mazda 3 however since I loved the way it looked both inside and out, it could play mp3 cds in the dealer stereo, and it got good gas mileage (I drove an hour each way to work).\n\nBought the car, waited for them to install the spoiler on the back (not a huge one, the car looked weird without it) and then took it home. After a few days I was so happy with the car. It was great. Then one day everything went bad.\n\nMy buddies were coming over to do some drinking. I hadn\'t been out of the house all day but when he got there we needed to make a booze run. We took my car, got back, my other buddy got there too.\n\n2 bottles of Boone\'s Farm later I was pretty drunk. Around 3:30am there was this explosion. We all looked at each other not knowing what it was. We figured it was a truck going by or something. Then the smoke detector went off. This time I got up, walked around the kitchen and looked down the laundry room hallway where I saw fire coming out from underneath and the sides of the door to my garage. I freaked out immediately, and all I could muster was "guys, we gotta get the hell outta here now!" My one buddy and I ran out of the condo shoeless and jacketless in order to get all of my neighbours out of their condos in case the fire spread. My other friend was smarter and grabbed his jacket and shoes.\n\nI called 112, the cops and the firetrucks came. By this time the entire complex was out it seemed. I came around the garage just in time to see the car explode into a massive fireball. Still shoeless and jacketless, a neighbour I didn\'t even know brought out some shoes and a jacket for my one friend and I.\n\nThe next day I went to look, and the condo was toast. The entire garage and hallway leading inside were completely destroyed. The rest of the place had smoke damage throughout, and there was a puddle of water where my floor used to be. Everything I owned was boxed and taken to a cleaning facility to be detoxed. The company that was hired to rebuild the place did everything in their power to repair my condo with sub-builder\'s grade materials and I had to fight them at every turn. I spent more time at work calling around to get things done than I did working. I literally had nothing for the 8 months I lived with my folks except a leaky air mattress I borrowed from someone, my computer, my clothing, and my GBA.\n\nMazda tried to blame the explosion on my friends and I, and we had to talk to all these lawyers and stuff. It took years to get back all the money from the stuff I lost, and some of my stuff came up missing afterwards.\nHere\'s a picture: http://i.imgur.com/Qo1MK.jpg\n\nI am looking forward to hearing from you again!\n\nThank you,\nLeo\n\n\nOn Mon, 26 Mar 2012 17:22:54 +0100 <gdepartmental2012@gmail.com> wrote:\n> [image:\n> http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTnVL1CnDGCB7fS2sGaBe69bs_qWyv58c6i2wDTPkSEbJxK5wWO]\n> *\n> Google Corporation\n> Belgrave House\n> 76 Buckingham\n> Palace Road\n> London SW1W 9TQ\n> *\n> *United Kingdom*\n> *\n> *\n> *Dear Winner: Mr. **Leo Brookes* *\n> \n> On Behalf of the Screening Committee of Google Corporation Email Lottery\n> Award Promotion, you are therefore cleared as approved Official beneficiary\n> of 450,000.00 {Four Hundred And Fifty Thousand Great British Pounds\n> Sterling}Please note that you are to contact: Mr. Richard Mallock of Efex\n> Courier Services UK, for assistance and formalities in Delivery of your\n> certified cheque/parcel without you coming down to the United Kingdom.\n> \n> Your documents has been securely sealed and packed for security reasons\n> which make it impossible for anyone to view it until it\'s been delivered to\n> you.Your parcel Order Number GUK/877/798/0147 has been sent to (Efex\n> Courier Services).

S'Hello,\n\n\nCan you please deduct this payment fee from the sum of my winnings? It would be easier for me.\n\nLet me tell you an amazing story that happened to me this week!\n\nI was walking my older dog the other night around 10PM. I had him off leash since it was late and we were in a neighbourhood (no one to bother). I kept track of him for poo-duty as he sniffed around and we were approaching an intersection. The house we were walking along was 20 feet from the sidewalk (where I was) and was edged by very large juniper bushes which he was checking out.\n\nSuddenly he stopped and dove into a bush. This was odd considering he was nearing 10 years old and although he\'s active, he\'s not crazy like that. Out of the bush comes some sort of snarl/scream and all I could think was "damn, he got a raccoon!" and out leaps a immature mountain lion (at least 20% larger then my dog). It runs off down the road, and I stand there, terrified, yelling "NO WAY" as he comes back to me wagging tail like he\'s the greatest dog ever, which is very likely considering that cat was much bigger then me.\nIt was probably his most well earned rawhide bone he\'s ever earned.\n\nThanks,\nLeo\n\n\nOn Wed, 28 Mar 2012 11:23:43 +0100 <gdepartmental2012@gmail.com> wrote:\n> Google Corporation\n> Belgrave House\n> 76 Buckingham\n> Palace Road\n> London SW1W 9TQ\n> United Kingdom\n> \n> Attention:  Leo Brookes\n> \n> Thanks for your prompt response, please we will kindly appreciate if you\n> can fill the verification and funds release form.

S'Hello,\n\n\nThank you for your reply.\n\nI look forward to collecting my prize as soon as possible.\n\nLet me tell you a story young person from my past.\n\nI once lived in a small town in the Appalachians. The town was too small to support any kind of hospital, but they had a diner that functioned as both the local watering hole, and the doctor\'s office (the doctor owned the place and also served as the main cook). You could sit at the bar next to someone and not know if they were getting something to eat, or if they were about to get inoculated.\n\nThis town was very very small and remote. The schoolhouse I went to is the smallest public school in that state by a long shot. The senior class (this school went K-12, and still only had about 40 kids, not all of them lived in the town) did a family tree project and discovered that they were all related. Not even distantly; it was like third cousin or something. The punchline, they still held prom.\n\nAlso, our "neighbour" who lived somewhat close as the crow flys, but about 45 minutes driving through mountains, gave my mom her old wood-fired range because she had just been hooked up with electricity and didn\'t need it anymore. Keep in mind that this was the mid 90\'s.\n\nI have too many stories about that place and the crazy folks who live there. I didn\'t think any towns like that still existed, but they\'re out there. They\'re kind of like time capsules. Tell me if you\'d like me to tell you more stories! I have many!\n\nRegards,\nLeo\n\n\nOn Wed, 28 Mar 2012 11:38:09 +0100 <gdepartmental2012@gmail.com> wrote:\n> Attention: Leo Brookes\n> \n> I want you tho understand that your parcel is protected by a hardcover\n> insurance policy which makes it impossible to deduct any amount from the\n> Prize before it has been remitted to you.

S'Hello,\n\n\nThanks for getting back to me.\n\nLet me tell you an amazing story that happened to me this week!\n\nI was walking my older dog the other night around 10PM. I had him off leash since it was late and we were in a neighbourhood (no one to bother). I kept track of him for poo-duty as he sniffed around and we were approaching an intersection. The house we were walking along was 20 feet from the sidewalk (where I was) and was edged by very large juniper bushes which he was checking out.\n\nSuddenly he stopped and dove into a bush. This was odd considering he was nearing 10 years old and although he\'s active, he\'s not crazy like that. Out of the bush comes some sort of snarl/scream and all I could think was "damn, he got a raccoon!" and out leaps a immature mountain lion (at least 20% larger then my dog). It runs off down the road, and I stand there, terrified, yelling "NO WAY" as he comes back to me wagging tail like he\'s the greatest dog ever, which is very likely considering that cat was much bigger then me.\nIt was probably his most well earned rawhide bone he\'s ever earned.\n\nRegards,\nPatrick Turner\n\n\nOn Fri, 30 Mar 2012 03:59:21 +0000 <unitednation_18@live.com> wrote:\n> UNITED NATIONS INTERNATIONAL DONATION PROGRAMME\n> U.N.I.D.P\n> =20\n> \n> UNODONATION\n> =20\n> =20\n> Attention: Ethan Stokes\n> NOTIFICATION!!!\n> The\n> \n> \n>  UNITED NATIONS LOTTERY PROMOTION received your mail regarding the=20\n> $10m.Your lottery funds has been duely processed and verified.For you to re=\n> ceive the said funds=2Cits important you secure the Cost of Transfer certif=\n> icate in New York.Once you get the Cost of Transfer your funds will be avai=\n> lable.\n> \n> \n> Expecting your response soonest.\n> \n> Sincerely yours=2C\n> \n> \n> \n> Mr. Michael Ruse Rustin\n> (Clearance Officer)\n> United Nations International Draws Centre\n> \n> 124 Stockport Road=2C\n> Longsight=2C Manchester=20\n> M60 2DB United Kingdom.\n> Tel:447023022552?\n>  *****************************\n>  ****************************** ******************************=20\n> ****************************** *******\n> The United=20\n> Nations International Annual Donation Awards is proudly sponsored by the\n>  United Nations=2C Bill Gates Of Microsoft Inc=2C the sultan of=20\n> Brunei=2C Intel Group and a conglomeration of other international IT=20\n'

S"Hello,\n\n\nThanks for getting back to me so quickly.\n\n\nPlease allow me to introduce myself.\n\nFull name: Patrick Turner\nOccupation: a sales assistant\nAddress: 83 King Street\nPostcode: M2 4AH\nCountry: United Kingdom\nPhone number: 07154942360\n\nAnd that sums me up. Thanks for asking.\n\n\n\nI am glad the payment has been approved and we can get the formalities out of the way. I am hoping to receive my winnings soon.\n\nLet me tell you what happened to me the other day!\n\nI came home from work and walked into my apartment. I hear noises coming from my room but don't think anything of it because my cat is quite noisy. I get something from the fridge sit down and start watching T.V. Then I hear a sneeze. My brother isn't home. It came from my room. Huh.\n\nI calmly walk into my room figuring it's his girlfriend or something and there is a dude rummaging through my closet. I freak out, grab a sword (not a lethal one even) that I had hanging on my wall and demanded he get the hell out of my house.\n\nHe turns around and is as shocked as I am grabs an axe (also not lethal) that was in the closet, I swing my sword at him trying to scare him, he does the same to me and we both kind of ran out of the apartment together and proceeded to basically have a catfight with weapons in the middle of my apartment complex's courtyard.\n\nTurns out he lived next door and had some severe developmental disabilities. Thought he was in his house when he walked into mine (my brother forgot to lock the door) and was trying to figure out why everything was different. His caretaker came out and saw us being... well basically ridiculous and both freaking out and yelled at us. The volume of her voice was... epic. Ear shattering.\n\nIn the end we talked about it, I yelled at my brother for not locking the door, he promised to keep a better eye on her son and him and I write letters to each other now that we don't live next to each other.\n\nBest Wishes,\nPatrick\n\n\nOn Mon, 19 Mar 2012 11:31:41 +0000 <mspcustomercare@w.cn> wrote:\n> THIS SHOULD BE FILL BY THE BENEFICIARY OF=20\n> THE STATED FUND=2C FOR=20\n> VERIFICATION BEFORE TRANSFER TO ALLIED IRISH=20\n> BANK.\n> CONTACT PERSON:SIR THOMAS COX\n> EMAIL:aib.fundstransfer@aib-online.co.cc\n> BANK NAME:ALLIED IRISH BANK\n> TEL:+44-701-005-8891\n> FAX:+44 872 331 3785\n> BENEFICIARY FIRST=20\n> NAME......................\n> \n> \n> BENEFICIARY LAST=20\n> NAME......................\n> NATIONALITY...................................\n> RESIDENTIAL=20\n> ADDRESS.........................\n> \n> \n> DATE OF=20\n> BIRTH................................\n> SEX...............................................\n> TEL.=20\n> NUMBER....................................\n> \n> FAX=20\n> NUMBER.....................................\n> EMAIL=20\n> ADDRESS.................................\n> \n> \n> AMOUNT=20\n> WON...................................\n> BATCH=20\n> NUMBER..................................\n> \n> \n> REFERENCE=20\n> N?..................................\n> OCCUPATION.....................................\n> \n> \n> MARITAL=20\n> STATUS...............................\n> \n> DECLARATION:\n> \n> I..........................................................H=20\n> EREBY\n> DECLARE THAT THE ABOVE DATA ARE TRUE.

S"Dear Allen Leslie,\n\n\nYou say I've won the lottery, but I don't recall entering into that lottery. Through I often enter the National Lottery, I've only won very small prizes once in a while. How do I know this is real? I'm not very computer savvy, so forgive me if I sound not as confident.\n\nI understand you would like to find out more about me, so let me introduce myself.\n I am Ethan Stokes, it is great to meet you. Please call me Ethan. I work as an accountant for a small firm in Manchester. I'm 47, but I feel younger in spirit.  I live in UK, which is an amazing country. My full address is 21 Quay Street, Manchester, M3 4AE.  07425902430 is my personal phone number and my email is ethanstokes51@yahoo.co.uk. \nSo, that's me in short. Thanks for asking.\n\n\nI need to ask you a few questions.\nDo I have to pay any administration fees to release my prize. If so, can I pay for this from my winnings?\nHow can I get the winnings delivered to me? Do I get a cheque, a wire transfer or some other method?\nHow do I know I can trust you?\n\n\nThanks,\nEthan\n\n\nOn Thu Mar 22 12:37:48 2012 <allenleslie1@hotmail.co.za> wrote:\n> \n>                                            BLACKBERRY 12TH ANNIVERSARY PROMOTION\n> \n> Blackberry Marketing Centre\n> 67 Shaftesbury Ave\n> Westminster, London\n> United Kingdom W1D 6\n> \n> Dear Award winner,\n> \n> Winning Reference Number: BBWINXPWISA79822\n> File number: BB255/647/390\n> \n> This is to inform you that you have won an Amount of Eight hundred thousand British Pounds (800,000.00 GBP) in the Blackberry 12th Anniversary Promotion as organized by the Marketing Centre of RIM Inc, held in London, United Kingdom, \n> \n> BlackBerry is a line of mobile e-mail and Smartphone device developed and designed by Research In Motion (RIM).

S"Hello,\n\n\nI am glad to hear back from you.\n\nI look forward to collecting my prize as soon as possible.\n\nLet me tell you what happened to me the other day!\n\nI came home from work and walked into my apartment. I hear noises coming from my room but don't think anything of it because my cat is quite noisy. I get something from the fridge sit down and start watching T.V. Then I hear a sneeze. My brother isn't home. It came from my room. Huh.\n\nI calmly walk into my room figuring it's his girlfriend or something and there is a dude rummaging through my closet. I freak out, grab a sword (not a lethal one even) that I had hanging on my wall and demanded he get the hell out of my house.\n\nHe turns around and is as shocked as I am grabs an axe (also not lethal) that was in the closet, I swing my sword at him trying to scare him, he does the same to me and we both kind of ran out of the apartment together and proceeded to basically have a catfight with weapons in the middle of my apartment complex's courtyard.\n\nTurns out he lived next door and had some severe developmental disabilities. Thought he was in his house when he walked into mine (my brother forgot to lock the door) and was trying to figure out why everything was different. His caretaker came out and saw us being... well basically ridiculous and both freaking out and yelled at us. The volume of her voice was... epic. Ear shattering.\n\nIn the end we talked about it, I yelled at my brother for not locking the door, he promised to keep a better eye on her son and him and I write letters to each other now that we don't live next to each other.\n\nBest Wishes,\nEthan Stokes\n\n\nOn Tue, 27 Mar 2012 02:40:18 +0200 (CEST) <allenleslie2012@consultant.com> wrote:\n> Claim Consultant & Solicitor.\n> Suite 114\n> \n> 8.TA Shopping Complex,\n> Richards Bay,\n> South Africa.      \n> Date: 2012-03-27\n> \n> Dear Sir\n> We are waiting for the details required from you to process your prize winning.

S'Hello,\n\n\nI look forward to collecting my prize as soon as possible.\n\nLet me tell you an amazing story that happened to me this week!\n\nI was walking my older dog the other night around 10PM. I had him off leash since it was late and we were in a neighbourhood (no one to bother). I kept track of him for poo-duty as he sniffed around and we were approaching an intersection. The house we were walking along was 20 feet from the sidewalk (where I was) and was edged by very large juniper bushes which he was checking out.\n\nSuddenly he stopped and dove into a bush. This was odd considering he was nearing 10 years old and although he\'s active, he\'s not crazy like that. Out of the bush comes some sort of snarl/scream and all I could think was "damn, he got a raccoon!" and out leaps a immature mountain lion (at least 20% larger then my dog). It runs off down the road, and I stand there, terrified, yelling "NO WAY" as he comes back to me wagging tail like he\'s the greatest dog ever, which is very likely considering that cat was much bigger then me.\nIt was probably his most well earned rawhide bone he\'s ever earned.\n\nBest Wishes,\nEthan Stokes\n\n\nOn Tue, 27 Mar 2012 22:08:47 +0200 (CEST) <allenleslie2012@consultant.com> wrote:\n> Claim Consultant & Solicitor.\n> Suite 114\n> \n> 8.TA Shopping Complex,\n> Richards Bay,\n> South Africa.      \n> Date: 2012-03-27\n> \n> Dear Ethan Stokes,\n> \n> Prior to your payment proceed, i wish to let you know the position of exchange control authorities in every country especially when huge sum of money is involved on transfer, therefore the exchange control authority will regularize the payment in accordance with their permisible limit or it may warrant clearance request of some legal requisite documents as proof of fund origin which we have applied to get before the fund is transferred.

S"Hello Clinton W. E.,\n\n\nThis is unbelievable!!! Simply amazing!!! This is the best day of my life. I've been playing many lotteries for over 10 years now, but I've hardly ever won anything. I am happy to know that my luck has now finally turned around.\nBefore we continue, please help me by answering a few questions.\nAre there any taxes that I need to pay on these winnings. If so, is there a way for me to avoid them?\nDo I have to pay any administration fees to release my prize. If so, can I pay for this from my winnings?\nCan I get my winnings in a different currency? I'd be interested to get them in Australian dollars.\n\n\nThank you,\nLeo Brookes\n\n\nOn Thu Mar 22 12:39:30 2012 <m.sclaim@blumail.org> wrote:\n> \n> It has finally come to our notice that you have not claimed your winning price.

S'Hello,\n\n\nI am glad to hear back from you.\n\nLet me tell you a story.\n\nMy fianc\xc3\xa9 and I had talked about getting a pet. Growing up, I had only had cats. As an adult, I am highly allergic to them, so I we decided a dog would be best. I had no idea if I would even like having a dog since I had never even played with one.\n\nI read up on caring for dogs, and was super stoked that our town was going to have a Pet Expo soon. We went to it, hoping to get some info about breeds, adoption, supplies, etc.\nThe Expo turned out to be pretty unhelpful as most of the vendors were selling dog clothes and treats. As we were leaving I noticed that there were a couple of booths on the outskirts of the expo that we missed. As we walked toward them, I saw that one had a couple of brown-ish dogs. The smaller of the two really caught my eye. He was just the most perfect puppy I had ever seen - he was brindled, and his fur looked like a brown tiger pelt. Long, graceful legs, a big ruff, and a sharp face and ears like a fox\'s. His big brown eyes were full of intelligence. I talked to the woman running the booth and found out that they were a non-profit rescue organization run solely by volunteers. She informed us that only the larger of the two dogs was available for adoption. I petted the little guy for a bit and left, but I found myself thinking about him a lot over the next few weeks. I hoped I would be able to find one like him when we were ready to adopt.\n\nI spent the next few months preparing to get a dog - renegotiating the lease to allow for a pet, getting supplies, researching foods, reading up on healthcare and first aid. Finally we were ready to find a dog to adopt. We went to humane society and struck out week after week. I just could not find a good match - none of the dogs felt like they would fit our little family.\nOne day, after yet another disappointing day at the Humane Society, I was half-heartedly browsing Craigslist\'s pet ads when I saw that there was an adoption event a few towns away. We went, expecting to be disappointed.\n\nSure enough, the dogs at the event were not much better. Too energetic, too small, too big, too loud. I gave up, and had started walking back to the car, when a white van pulled into the parking lot. My husband said we should stick around just in case the van was bringing more dogs. Sure enough, the driver got out and let out a single little brown dog. I immediately started walking toward the van, parked about 100 feet away. My heart knew well before my brain could register that I recognized that dog. As I walked faster and faster to the van, I remembered where I had seen him before. I shouted to my husband, "It\'s him! It\'s my dog!".\n\nIt turns out that he was the dog from the expo, and the last of his litter to find a home. No one else wanted him because he was shy and looked unusual. I thought he was beautiful. Within the hour he was buckled up in the backseat in his doggie seatbelt on his way to his new home.\n\nPlease get back to me as soon as possible.\n\nKind Regards,\nLeo Brookes\nNone'

S'Hello,\n\n\nLet me tell you a story, perhaps you can help.\n\nWe have this local crazy lady... Everybody called her "Crazy Gina". Apparently at one time she was a normal person and had a family and everything, and then she started doing drugs and kind of lost it.\n\nShe had a garden in her front yard, which sounds normal... But she was "growing" rubber boots. She had planted like 20 or so rubber boots with just the tops hanging out. And she had another 30 or so just in a huge pile. It\'s been there for as long as I can remember.\n\nShe decided one day that she was going to paint her house, which again sounds kind of normal... Except instead of doing it like a normal person, she bought a can of spray paint. And instead of spray painting like a normal person to try to get even coverage, she just sprayed it all over... That led to more people going up to her house and spraying random things at it.\n\nThen I guess she got tired of that so she ripped off like half of her siding. Not all of it, no. Just half. And she was the only person in the entire town to have bars on her windows.\n\nAnd man, you ever walk down the street she lives on... Wow, she\'d be yelling "Get the bloody hell away from my house!" and then you\'d have to run away from her and everything. \n\nAnything like that ever happen to you?\n\nI hope to hear from you soon.\n\nBest Regards,\nLeo Brookes\nNone'

S"Hello,\n\n\nI am glad to hear back from you.\n\nThanks for helping me with the processing of the payment.\n\nLet me tell you a bit of a weird story from my past.\n\nA few years ago a friend of mine unsuccessfully tried to kill himself by overdosing on pain pills. He was taken to a small hospital in Dover. I was living in Liverpool at the time so some friends as I drove down to check on him. When we made it down to the hospital we were asked to wait outside his room while a nurse was in the room attending to our friend. While we were standing in the hall a man dressed in coveralls walked up to us. He was obviously a mechanic by way of the oil stains on his coveralls and the strong smell of grease. We struck up a conversation with him and he told us he\xe2\x80\x99d been down the street at the local mechanic shop (suspicions confirmed!) and he walked down to check on (what I now assumed to be) our mutual friend. He moved to walk into the room and we told him everyone was supposed to wait outside till the nurse was done in the room. \xe2\x80\x9cIts okay\xe2\x80\x9d he says, pulling a stethoscope out of the pocket of his coveralls \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the Doctor\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nStrange. Anything like that ever happen to you?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you!\n\nThanks,\nLeo\n\n\nOn Mon, 26 Mar 2012 19:12:21 +0100 (BST) <mr.joso2011@yahoo.fr> wrote:\n> Dear Leo,=0AI=0A am very happy in receiving your reply which give me more a=\n> ssurance that=0A you are honest and ready to assist me which i want to asur=\n> e you that =0Ayou dont have anything to be afraid of in this transaction be=\n> cause I am a=0A senior staff of the bank that has put in long term of merit=\n> eous service=0A to The Bank and well trusted.\n> \n> =C2=A0Account officer to late Mr. Henri=0A Potter=C2=A0 Of France=C2=A0 who=\n>  is an gold merchant Agent here in Ouagadougou =0ABurkina Faso, a well know=\n> n Philanthropist before he died.He made a Will =0Astating that $14.5Million=\n>  dollars (Fourteen million Five hundred =0Athousand USD) should be given to=\n>  a citizen of our choice overseas as one=0A of his own donation to humanity=\n>  .the bank gave me the permition to have=0A made a random draw of email's a=\n> nd your e-mail address=0A was picked as the beneficiary to this Will.\n> \n> =C2=A0I am particularly =0Ainterested in securing this money from the Bank =\n> because they have issued=0A a notice instructing me been the account office=\n> r to produce the =0Abeneficiary of this will in this fiscal year 2012 else =\n> the money will be=0A credited to the Government treasury as perlaw here.It =\n> is my utmost =0Adesire to execute the Will of my late client Mr. Henri Pott=\n> er=C2=A0 since he =0Ais no more alive, both wife Lidia Potter, and daughter=\n>  Jennie Potter=C2=A0 =0Aare no more, may there soul rest in perfect peace.\n> \n> Once more this=0A transaction is 100% risk free which I earlier assure you =\n> about and I =0Atruly hope that you will carry out my instructions to the le=\n> tter.I trust=0A you with my mind although we have not meet before and this =\n> transaction =0Awill not take more than 10 working days before the fund will=\n>  be=C2=A0 =0Atransferred to your account and it is then I will travel down =\n> to meet =0Awith you in your country for the=0A sharing of the money and inv=\n> est my share in your country under your own=0A instruction as long as you a=\n>  good citizen of your country.\n> =C2=A0\n> Furthermore,=0A know that this fund will be term as unclaim fund before the=\n>  middle or =0Aend of this fiscal year so we must hasten up whatsoever we ar=\n> e going to =0Ado about it before it is forfeited as unclaimed bill and sent=\n>  to the =0Atreasury.It has taken me some time to map out this plan so I wil=\n> l not =0Awant anything that will=C2=A0 jeopardize the effort that i have pu=\n> t in this =0Atransaction since,so make sure that you keep this transaction =\n> 100% =0Asecret as possible because nobody loves a successful person so that=\n>  =0Athere will be no problem when this fund get to your account and also =\n> =0Athat our chances should not be in vain.\n> =C2=A0\n> Be aware that any =0Aexpenses will be shared between me and you which will =\n> be during the =0Aprocess of the transaction and after we shall deduct it on=\n>  the =0Apercentage i=0A earliermentioned.\n> \n> =C2=A0Note:Do assure me that you will be sincere to=0A me until the end of =\n> this transaction and do not hesitate to ask me any =0Aquestion which you kn=\n> ow is bordering your mind because I am ready to =0Aanswer any question whic=\n> h you will ask.\n> =C2=A0\n> This is my mobile =0Anumber+226.78.80.76.15 which I will also want you to s=\n> end your direct =0Amobile number to me for easier communication so that I c=\n> an easily call =0Ayou for any urgent information=E2=80=99s in respect of th=\n> is transaction. so do =0Anot delay in calling me or send me an.urgent mail =\n> immediately you =0Areceive this mail as you know we don=E2=80=99t have any =\n> time to waste.\n> \n> I =0Awill send to you My Staff Id Card and also statement of account of thi=\n> s =0Afund as soon as you prove to me that you are ready to assist me in thi=\n> s =0Atransaction also to follow up my instruction's.\n> \n> Your share of this fund is 45% why my share is 55%.\n> \n> =C2=A0Which=0A you must make sure you state clearly which bank you=0A choos=\n> e to credit this fund into your account=C2=A0 SGBB bank here or =0Acorrespo=\n> ndence bank in Europe.If you need this fund to be credited to =0Ayour accou=\n> nt through this bank correspondence bank in Europe is agreed =0Aby me but y=\n> ou must agree to follow up my instruction's so as to avoid =0Amistake.\n> \n> thanks\n> yours sincerely\n> Mr Josn Sror.\n"

S'Hello,\n\n\nI am glad to hear back from you.\n\nLet me tell you a story young person from my past.\n\nI once lived in a small town in the Appalachians. The town was too small to support any kind of hospital, but they had a diner that functioned as both the local watering hole, and the doctor\'s office (the doctor owned the place and also served as the main cook). You could sit at the bar next to someone and not know if they were getting something to eat, or if they were about to get inoculated.\n\nThis town was very very small and remote. The schoolhouse I went to is the smallest public school in that state by a long shot. The senior class (this school went K-12, and still only had about 40 kids, not all of them lived in the town) did a family tree project and discovered that they were all related. Not even distantly; it was like third cousin or something. The punchline, they still held prom.\n\nAlso, our "neighbour" who lived somewhat close as the crow flys, but about 45 minutes driving through mountains, gave my mom her old wood-fired range because she had just been hooked up with electricity and didn\'t need it anymore. Keep in mind that this was the mid 90\'s.\n\nI have too many stories about that place and the crazy folks who live there. I didn\'t think any towns like that still existed, but they\'re out there. They\'re kind of like time capsules. Tell me if you\'d like me to tell you more stories! I have many!\n\nWarm Regards,\nEthan\n\n\nOn Sat, 24 Mar 2012 20:26:28 +0800 <informationunit0@foxmail.com> wrote:\n> Q09OR0EgVUsgTE9UVE8NCjQyIFBhcmsgQXZlbnVlLEJhcmJvdXJuZSwNCldvcmNlc3RlcixV\n> bml0ZWQgS2luZ2RvbS4NCkZpbGUgTm86IFJlZiBOTy46IFVLTC83NS1BMDg2ODc1MjAxMg0K\n> DQoNCkNPTkdSQVRVTEFUSU9OUyEhIQ0KDQoNCiBBVFROOiAgV2lubmVyDQogDQogSSAgd2lz\n> aCB0byBjb25ncmF0dWxhdGUgeW91IG9uY2UgYWdhaW4gb24gYmVoYWxmIG9mIHRoZSBDb25n\n> YSBFbWFpbCBPbmxpbmUgIFByb21vdGlvbiBmb3IgYmVlbiBzZWxlY3RlZCBhcyBvbmUgb2Yg\n> b3VyIGx1Y2t5IGVtYWlsIHdpbm5lciBoZWxkIDI5dGggIG9mIEZlYnJ1YXJ5LCAyMDEyLiBZ\n> b3VyIGVtYWlsIGFkZHJlc3MgZW1lcmdlZCBhcyBhIGx1Y2t5IHdpbm5lciBmcm9tIGEgIHJh\n> bmRvbSBzZWxlY3Rpb24gb2YgZW1haWwgZGF0YWJhc2UsVGhlIGVudGlyZSBDb25nYSBUZWFt\n> IGV4cHJlc3Mgb3VyICBmdWxsIGZlbGljaXRhdGlvbiB3aXRoIHlvdSBhbmQgeW91ciBmYW1p\n> bHkuDQogDQpJJ20gZ2xhZCB0byBpbmZvcm0geW91IHRoYXQgeW91ciB3aW5uaW5nIGNvZGUg\n> aXMgYmVpbmcgcHJvY2Vzc2VkICBieSB0aGlzIG9mZmljZSBiYXNlZCBvbiB0aGUgd2lubmlu\n> ZyBkYXRhIHdlIHJlcXVpcmUgYmVsb3cuDQoNCg0KKllvdXIgRXhhY3QgTmFtZXMuKlBob25l\n> IG51bWJlcnMvRmF4Lg0KKiBDdXJyZW50IHJlc2lkZW50aWFsIGFkZHJlc3MuDQoqU2V4Og0K\n> KkNoZXF1ZSBQYXltZW50IE9SIEJhbmsgRHJhZnQgUGF5bWVudCBDSE9PU0UgT05FDQoNCg0K\n> DQogVGh1cyAgYWxsIHRoZSBsZWdhbCBkb2N1bWVudGF0aW9ucyBmb3IgdGhlIHJlbWl0dGFu\n> Y2Ugb2YgeW91ciBwcml6ZSB3aWxsIGJlZW4gIHByb2Nlc3NlZCBzdWNjZXNzZnVsbHkgd2l0\n> aGluIGFuIGhvdXIgb25jZSBwcm92aWRlZCB0aGlzIGFib3ZlICBpbmZvLGhlbmNlIHlvdXIg\n> cGF5bWVudCBvZiAoJDUwMC4wMDApIEZpdmUgSHVuZHJlZCB0aG91c2FuZCB1bml0ZWQgIHN0\n> YXRlcyBkb2xsYXJzIHdpbGwgIGJlIGFwcHJvdmVkIHRvIHlvdSBmb3IgY2xhaW1zLg0KDQoN\n> CkEgIENlcnRpZmllZCBDaGVxdWUgb3IgQmFuayBEcmFmdCB3aWxsIGJlICBpc3N1ZWQgaW4g\n> eW91ciBuYW1lIGJ5IHRoZSAgQ29uZ2EgVGVhbSBoZXJlIGluIChVSykgYW5kIGF1dGhvcml6\n> ZWQgYnkgdGhlIEJyaXRpc2ggR2FtaW5nIEJvYXJkIHRvIGJlICBkZWxpdmVyZWQgdG8geW91\n> IGJ5IG91ciBDb3VyaWVyIENvbXBhbnkgRGlwbG9tYXRpYyBIZW5yeSBIZW5yaWVjaCBpbiAg\n> YXNzb2NpYXRpb24gd2l0aCBGZWRFeCB3aXRob3V0IHRoZSBub3JtYWwgZGVsaXZlcnkgZmVl\n> IC4NCg0KDQogQWxsICBvcmRlcnMgbm90IGRlbGl2ZXJlZCB3aXRoaW4gRml2ZSAoNSkgd29y\n> a2luZyBkYXlzIGZyb20gdGhlIGFycml2YWwgb2YgIHlvdXIgcGFyY2VsIGluIHRoZSBGZWRF\n> eCBvZmZpY2Ugd2lsbCBsZWFkIHRvIHJldHVybiBvZiB5b3VyIHBhcmNlbCB0byAgdGhlIHBy\n> b21vIG9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbiBhcyB1bmNsYWltZWQgcGFja2FnZSBhbmQgeW91ciBjYXNoIHBy\n> aXplIHdpbGwgYmUgIGRlZW1lZCB0byBoYXZlIGJlZW4gZm9yZmVpdGVkIGJ5IHlvdSBhcyBz\n> dGF0ZWQgYnkgdGhlIENvbmdhIEF3YXJkIFByb21vICBMb3R0ZXJ5IFRlYW0uDQoNCg0KUGxl\n> YXNlICBiZSB3YXJuZWQ6IEZvciBzZWN1cml0eSByZWFzb25zLCB5b3UgYXJlIGFkdmlzZWQg\n> dG8ga2VlcCB5b3VyIHdpbm5pbmcgIGluZm9ybWF0aW9uIChVS0wvNzUtQTA4Njg3NTIwMTIg\n> KSBjb25maWRlbnRpYWwgdGlsbCB5b3VyIGNlcnRpZmllZCAgY2hlcXVlL2RyYWZ0IGlzIGdp\n> dmVuIHRvIHlvdS4gVGhpcyBpcyBwYXJ0IG9mIG91ciBwcmVjYXV0aW9uYXJ5IG1lYXN1cmUg\n> IHRvIGF2b2lkIHVud2FycmFudGVkIGltcGVyc29uYXRpb24gb3IgYWJ1c2Ugb2YgdGhpcyBw\n> cm9ncmFtIGJ5IHNvbWUgIGluZGl2aWR1YWwuDQogDQpBbHNvICBkbyBhbHdheXMgZmVlbCBm\n> cmVlIHRvIGNhbGwgYW55dGltZSBmb3IgbW9yZSAgaW5mb3JtYXRpb24sQ29uZ3JhdHVsYXRp\n> b25zIG9uIGJlaGFsZiBvZiBTdGFmZidzIGFuZCBtZW1iZXIgb2YgdGhlIENvbmdhICBFbWFp\n> bCBQcm9tb3Rpb24gQm9hcmQgSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbCEhDQoNCg0KUkVHQVJEUy4NCk1SIEdF\n> T1JHRSBXSElURQ0KVGVsICs0NC03MDMtNTk1LTgzMjQNCkNPTkdBIENMQUlNUyBERVBBUlRN\n> RU5UIC4gICAgICAgIA0KQ09QWVJJR0hUIDIwMTIuIEFMTCBSSUdIVFMgUkVTRVJWRUQNCg0K\n> DQpXZWJzaXRlOiBodHRwOi8vd3d3LmNvbmdhbG90dG8uY29tLw0KDQoNCg0KIA0KIA0KLS0t\n> LS0tLS0tLS0tLS0tLS0tIE9yaWdpbmFsIC0tLS0tLS0tLS0tLS0tLS0tLQ0KRnJvbTogICJF\n> dGhhbiBTdG9rZXMiPGV0aGFuc3Rva2VzNTFAeWFob28uY28udWs+Ow0KRGF0ZTogIFNhdCwg\n> TWFyIDI0LCAyMDEyIDAzOjM0IEFNDQpUbzogICJpbmZvcm1hdGlvbnVuaXQwIjxpbmZvcm1h\n> dGlvbnVuaXQwQGZveG1haWwuY29tPjsgDQoNClN1YmplY3Q6ICBSZTogTm90aWZpY2F0aW9u\n> IChZb3UgV29uKQ0KDQogDQpIZWxsbywNCg0KDQpZb3Ugc2F5IEkndmUgd29uIHRoZSBsb3R0\n> ZXJ5LCBidXQgSSBkb24ndCByZWNhbGwgZW50ZXJpbmcgaW50byB0aGF0IGxvdHRlcnkuIFRo\n> cm91Z2ggSSBvZnRlbiBlbnRlciB0aGUgTmF0aW9uYWwgTG90dGVyeSwgSSd2ZSBvbmx5IHdv\n> biB2ZXJ5IHNtYWxsIHByaXplcyBvbmNlIGluIGEgd2hpbGUuIEhvdyBkbyBJIGtub3cgdGhp\n> cyBpcyByZWFsPyBJJ20gbm90IHZlcnkgY29tcHV0ZXIgc2F2dnksIHNvIGZvcmdpdmUgbWUg\n> aWYgSSBzb3VuZCBub3QgYXMgY29uZmlkZW50Lg0KVGhpcyBzb3VuZHMgc28gYW1hemluZywg\n> YnV0IEkgbmVlZCB0byBrbm93IHRoZSBhbnN3ZXJzIHRvIGEgZmV3IHF1ZXN0aW9ucy4NCldo\n> ZXJlIGFyZSBteSB3aW5uaW5ncyBsb2NhdGVkPw0KRG8gSSBoYXZlIHRvIHBheSBhbnkgYWRt\n> aW5pc3RyYXRpb24gZmVlcyB0byByZWxlYXNlIG15IHByaXplLiBJZiBzbywgY2FuIEkgcGF5\n> IGZvciB0aGlzIGZyb20gbXkgd2lubmluZ3M/DQpDYW4gSSBnZXQgbXkgd2lubmluZ3MgaW4g\n> YSBkaWZmZXJlbnQgY3VycmVuY3k/IEknZCBiZSBpbnRlcmVzdGVkIHRvIGdldCB0aGVtIGlu\n> IEF1c3RyYWxpYW4gZG9sbGFycy4NCg0KDQpCZXN0IFJlZ2FyZHMsDQpFdGhhbg0KDQoNCk9u\n> IEZyaSBNYXIgMjMgMTk6MzQ6MzMgMjAxMiA8aW5mb3JtYXRpb251bml0MEBmb3htYWlsLmNv\n> bT4gd3JvdGU6DQo+IA0KPiBZb3VyIGVtYWlsIGFkZHJlc3MganVzdCB3b24gdGhlIHN1bSBv\n> ZiAkNTAwLDAwMCBmcm9tIG91ciB1ayBMb3R0byBDb25nYSBFbWFpbCBwcm9tbyxyZXBseSB5\n> b3VyIGNsYWltcyBhZ2VudCBpbiB0aGlzIG1haWwgd2l0aCB5b3VyIGZ1bGwgbmFtZXMoR2Vv\n> cmdlIFdoaXRlIFRlbCAjIDogKzQ0LTcwMjQwIDc4MzU2KQ==\n'

S'Good day,\n\nwarmest greetings to you. We know that our mail will be surprising to you since you do not know me and my brother, please, we are very sorry if we disturb your privacy. We really wish to contact you for a business venture which we intend to establish with you.\n\nThe reason why we have contacted you this way is because of the urgency needed and pressure which we are now facing to find some one to help us. Our Late father before he died deposited a huge amount Ten million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$10.5Million) in one of the leading bank here in Ouagadougou Burkina-Faso. I and my younger brother are looking for your help to guide us on how this money will be transferred abroad so that we can move out of here to continue our education in your country while you take charge of the investment with this money.\n\nWe are humbly seeking your godly assistance in the following ways; to provide an account into which this money would be transferred and to serve as a guardian of this money since we are Orphans and still very young.\n\nIf you can be of an assistance to us, we will be pleased to offer to you 30% of the total money. Please, we are waiting for your response urgently so that we can discuss more with you.\n\nGod Bless you abundantly\n\nYours Sincerely,\nMiss. Sophia and David Tagro.\n'

S'Hello David,\n\n\nI am so sorry to hear this horrible news. I hope things get better for you. My prayers and thoughts are with you. I hope you soon recover. I will do my best to assist you in your efforts.\nPlease allow me to ask you a few questions before we proceed further.\nDo you have a favorite movie? This might be weird, but you sound like a person who would enjoy Titanic!\nInternational transfers and legal fees can be expensive. Who will cover these?\nDo you have any brothers or sisters that also need help? If so, can you take care of them when we arrange everything for you?\n\n\nBest Wishes,\nEthan Stokes\n\n\nOn Fri Mar 23 19:37:38 2012 <dt.sophia@gmx.com> wrote:\n> Good day,\n> \n> warmest greetings to you.

S"Hi Lorna,\n\n\nI would like to express my sincere condolences for your loss. News like that always bring us sorrow and heartbreak, but from experience I can tell you that time heals all wounds. Maybe in a few months, if not years, you will start to regain your joy in life and put the pain of your loss behind you. I'll do my best to help you through the process. It was not long ago, when I lost my dear mother. Please let me know what I can do to help you and I will do my best.\nI hope you will be able to bare through with me and answer a few questions.\nHave you contacted the authorities about your situation?\nDo you have a favorite movie? This might be weird, but you sound like a person who would enjoy Titanic!\n\n\nBest Regards,\nEthan Stokes\n\n\nOn Fri Mar 23 19:40:02 2012 <ajarakones@gmail.com> wrote:\n> \n> My Dearest,\n> \n>   Good day to you, I have decided to contact you after much thought considering\n> the fact that we have not meet before, but because of the circumstance oblige\n> me, I decided to contact you due to the urgency of my present situation here in\n> the refugee camp, I am Miss Ajara  Kones, 25yrs old female and I from Kenya here\n> in Africa; my father was the former Kenyan road Minister.

S"Hi Levi Johnson,\n\n\nThis sounds like a sweet job. I'd be interested to learn more and perhaps work this, as it sounds like a great opportunity.\n\nPlease allow me to introduce myself.\n I'm Ethan Stokes, but please just call me Ethan. I work for a small firm here in the city as an accountant. I've just turned 47 this month.  I live in UK, which is an amazing country. My full address is 21 Quay Street, Manchester, M3 4AE. My post code is M3 4AE. My telephone number is 07425902430. I can also be reached on ethanstokes51@yahoo.co.uk. \nSo this is me. If there is anything I've missed, please tell me and I'll try to answer.\n\n\nIn going forward, I'd like to find out more about the mystery shopper position, so please help me by answering these questions.\nIs it possible for me to conduct personal shopping, as well as mystery shopping on the same visit, or would you advise against it?\nCan you explain to me exactly how mystery shopper works? I want to be sure I am applying for the correct position.\nCan I trust you that this is a legitimate position?\n\n\nKind Regards,\nEthan Stokes\n\n\nOn Fri Mar 23 19:42:10 2012 <mysteryshopperassignmentincs@gmail.com> wrote:\n> \n> Dear Shopper,\n> \n> We are a company that conduct surveys and evaluate other companies.
