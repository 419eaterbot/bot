RESULTED INTO POOR VISION.FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS NOW I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A MIRACLE,
A SPIRITUAL CURE ALL TO NO AVAIL. RECENTLY MY DOCTOR GAVE ME VERY BAD NEWS WHICH IS VERY
DISTURBING TO MY EARS, HE SAID THAT IN ABOUT THREE MONTHS TIME THAT I WILL SOON DIE OF
MY ILLNESS, I HAVE NO CLOSE RELATIVE AROUND AND THE ONLY ONE I HAVE WHICH
HAPPENS TO BE A DISTANT COUSIN OF MINE MRS LINDA LEFLER LEFT FOR AUSTRALIA 10 YEARS AGO
