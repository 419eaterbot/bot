Subject: FROM MADAM GRACE MBAGUNA

My name is MADAM GRACE MBAGUNA, and I am a banker. It is true that we have not met each others in person, but I strongly believe that no trust, no friendship in every business. I have a deceased customers pending fund, which I am his personal financier adviser before his accidental death, that being the main reason why I alone working in the bank here, know much about the existence of this fund and the secrets surrounding this money. But before I disclose the full details to you, I will like to know your interest and willingness to assist me by reverting back to me with your :

Private Email ID

Age.

Private Phone no. for further confidential details about the said fund.

Yours Faithfully
Madam Grace Mbaguna
