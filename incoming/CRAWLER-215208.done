PHILIPPIANS - 4 v13 I Can Do All Things.

Dearest One Please Be Honest,

My name is Mrs. Sandra Davies, I am a dying woman who had decided to
donate what I have to the Charities. I am 69 years old and was diagnosed
for cancer about four years ago, immediately after the death of my
husband, I have been touched to donate from what I have inherited from my
late husband for the good work rather than allow his relatives to use my
husband's hard earned fund.

When I was in better health, I never really cared for any body with no
children of my own and a late husband I was a selfish and greedy
person. I have decided to donate the sum of $10.8M to you, so you can
disburse to charities, widows, orphans and less privileged.

I was doing this myself but now my health has deteriorated, I wanted
my relatives to do this for me but they only saw it as an opportunity
to enrich themselves.

As I lay on my sick bed, I want you to help me in carrying out my last
wish on earth which will be very profitable to you. 

I will be going in for an operation soon, I want this last act of mine
to be an offering unto God, perhaps he will have mercy on me. Please
contact my lawyer with the below:

Henry Townsend Esq
twwesq@lawyer.com

Quote my ref # : will/Wlaw/Pn/lr/16/CUI when responding.

I am sending him a copy of this message as well so he is aware of my
intentions, Please use the funds well and always extend the good works
to others.   Contact my lawyer via is above email and be free to reach
me on my private email address @ (daviesministry011@aol.com)

Stay blessed,
Mrs. Sandra Davies
