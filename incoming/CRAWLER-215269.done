                                            CONFIDENTIAL   INVESTMENT

Attn; Sir/Madam,

With due respect, trust and humility, I write to you this proposal, which I believe would be of great interest to you. I find your contact while I was doing a private research on the Internet for a reliable and capable foreign partner that will assist my family to transfer funds to your personal or company bank account for Investment purposes. 

I am Evans Loyd 27 years old, the first son of Late Mr. John Loyd of blessed memory and the "Chairman" of the farmer's co-operation in Zimbabwe. My late father was among the few blacks that were murdered in cold blood by the President Robert Mugabe during the land dispute that just happened in Zimbabwe. After the death of my father, we decided to move out from Zimbabwe because our live were in danger and insecure as my father was the target and we reasoned that our continued stay in Zimbabwe would eliminate our dear lives, thus we flew the country.

Before the death of my father, he went to South Africa and deposited the sum of twenty million United States Dollars ($20m) in a private security company in Johannesburg. This money was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland and Lesotho. Before his death, he was a major share holder of companies in Zimbabwe. After he died, we moved to South Africa with all the necessary documents related to this fund. We are here now as asylum seekers and as such the law of South Africa does not permit us to operate or open any bank account here in South Africa or be involved in any financial transaction with the bank.

That is why we contacted you so that we will transfer the money in the security company to your bank account as we have planned a successful transfer.

We are ready to compensate you with 20% of the total funds for accepting to assist us,5% will be used for any unforeseen situation during the transfer while 75% will be for my family's investment in your country.

Should you be ready to assist us as explained, kindly contact me on the above phone number and on receiving your acceptance, shall be glad to give you more clarification on the modalities needed for smooth successful completion of this transaction.
Thanks in anticipation.
