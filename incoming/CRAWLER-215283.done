 From :Mr.Maxwell Moore
Auditing / Accounting Director
Banque Internationale du Burkina [B.I.B]
West Africa

I am Mr Maxwell Moore, Head of Auditing/Accounting Director {B I B},BURKINA FASO. I have a urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. A German Citizen Mr Andreas Schranner made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$4.2Million in my bank. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.

After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers that Mr Andreas Schranner died some time ago without our knowledge,  Since we got this information about his death and on further investigation,I found Out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that he did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$4.2Million is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.

No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to the Laws of BURKINA FASO, at the expiration of 9 (nine) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the (B.F) Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr Andreas Schranner so that the fruits of his labor will not get into the hands of the government.This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full Names and Residencial address||Country of Origin ||Age ||Phone Number ||Your Sex || so that I can make some changes in his file immediately to purport you as his next of kin. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.

I will offer you 40% of this amount as soon as you declare your interest, 10% will be for expenses and 50% will be for me, Because i don't want anyone here in our bank to know my involvement until you confirm this fund into your account and ask me to come over for the sharing as I indicated and i assure you of my utmost support as it involves 100% RISK FREE. More details and my laid down strategy to realize this deal will be sent to you Upon your response. Awaiting your urgent reply.

This is my private email box contact me here.[maxwellmoore@mynet.com]

Regards.

Mr Maxwell Moore
