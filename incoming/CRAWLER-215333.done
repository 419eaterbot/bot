To whom it may concern.

I am Ahmad Hussein Bashar a native of Hama and a son of one of the leading
opposing figure to the government of Bashar al-Assad.I am 19 years of age
and an  undergraduate in the Damascus University in Damascus.Following the
political resentment and uprising in Syria which has inadvertently
degenerate into a civil war,  the al-Assad regime announced what is tagged
the total massacre of his political opponents and who he had called
dissidents to his rule in Syria. In this  event, the al-Assad government
declare the total whip out of the prominent leaders in duraa wherein my
father has been one among these leading figure.

On a fateful day while in school, watching the unfolding events going in
my country on the television particularly on the Aljazeera i saw a caption
on the area around  my neighborhood close to my father's house where the
pro-Al-Assad forces had surrounded with their weapons of destruction and
something struck my mind of my family and  immediately i received a
message on my phone that the pro-Al-Assad had just struck my neighborhood
and that our house was one of the major target by the al-Assad  forces and
to make the whole world down on me, my father was brutally eliminated from
the surface of the earth this ugly events made my mother collapsed seeing
her  husband swim in an ocean of blood and was rushed to a nearby hospital
by a member of the Red Cross but unfortunately she could not live to
explain it all as death claimed her away.

The Red Cross team and other people on rescue mission took my two kid
sisters away for proper care where i often go to pay them visitation and
until i discover how  endanger my life could be, that i had to flee away
for dear live to a neighboring country specifically Turkey as a refugee. I
have been living as a refugee since the whole incidents happened that i
could not even go back to my country in search of my sisters who i
believed remain as the only family i have on earth. During the lifetime of
my late father, he was an industrialist, a businessman and a
philanthropist who owned a large steel producing company and other assets
measurable in monetary terms.

Prior to his demise, he had a financial portfolio of $35.8 million United
States Dollars, which he deposited with a financial firm (UNCLAIMED
ASSET/ASSETS RE-UNITED,SWITZERLAND) in Geneva, Switzerland as part of his
investment. However, i have always known of this investment abroad since i
was 14 years because, my father of a blessed  memory had always made it
known to me that on my graduation from the university and after my master
in my course of study, i will be representing his business interest 
abroad. How painful is death to have short-lived his dream.

I have made a relentless efforts so far to contact my father's attorney
who is in charge of his estate in the person of Sir Abramson Onasis` whose
office is in London  United Kingdom and Switzerland respectively to know
more about my late father's wealth and how i could go about claiming the
estate but unfortunately, the attorney brought to my notice that he  could
only proceed on handling over the estate to me when i have attained the
age of 24 or wherein a person of a  full contractual capacity is brought
in to fulfill the  obligation as stated in the will left by my late
father. As  further explained by the attorney, the person of full
contractual capacity could be a relation or a trust.

I have been a person of desperate soul to get rid of my father's estate
because the attorney himself is an aged man in his late 70s and am afraid
death could visit him at any point in time and this might jeopardize my
chance of claiming my father's estate.

At this point i am consciously taking my time to source for a very
business minded person, who is also a God fearing and who will create time
to rescue me from this  dilemma to claim my late father's estate and also
a person who will guide me on a flourishing business to invest my own
share of the claim. You can get in touch with my late father's lawyer on
these email address : ( abramson.onasis@yahoo.co.uk )  so that he can
furnish you with the information to finalize the whole arrangement .

Sincerely,

Ahmad Hussein Bashar.
