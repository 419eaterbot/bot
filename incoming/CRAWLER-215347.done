Dear Friend,

Greetings my dearest one,my name is miss Vivian Justin Yak am 21 years old Girl from Southern Sudan.I want to have a common relationship with you, I need to tell you more things, but first I need your help to Stand for me as a trustee.

My father Dr.Justin Yak Arop was the former Minister for SPLA Affairs and Special Adviser to President Salva Kiir of South Sudan for Decentralization. My father Dr. Justin Yak, my mother including other top Military officers and top government officials where on board when the plane crashed on Friday May 02,2008. You can read more about the crash through the below site: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7380412.stm Some months after the burial of my father, my uncle conspired with my step mother and sold my father's properties to a Chinese Expatriate.  On a faithful morning I opened my father's briefcase and found out document which my beloved late father used and deposit money in a bank in Benin Repu blic, with my name as the next of kin. I traveled to  Benin Republic to withdraw the money so that I can start a better life and take care of myself. The Branch manager of the Bank whom I met in person told me that my present status does not permit me by the local law to clear money or make a transfer of money into an account, he advice me to provide a trustee who will help me and invest the money or I should wait till when I will get married it demand by their Authority.

I have chosen to contact you after my prayers and I believe that you will not betray  my trust. But rather take me as your own person and help me. Though you may wonder why I am so soon revealing myself to you without knowing you, well, I will say that my mind convinced me that you are the true person to help me.More so, I will like to disclose much to you if you can help me to relocate to your country because my uncle has threatened to assassinate me. The amount is $5.5Million and I have confi rmed from the bank here in Benin Republic,You will also help me to place the money in a more profitable business venture in your Country.

However, you will help by recommending a nice University in your country so that I can complete my studies.  It is my intention to compensate you with 15% of the total money for your services and the balance shall be my capital in your establishment As soon as I receive your interest in helping me,I will put things into action immediately. In the light of the above, I shall appreciate an urgent message indicating your ability and willingness to handle this transaction sincerely. Please do keep this only to your self. I beg you not to disclose it till i come over because I am afraid of my wicked uncle who has threatened to kill me.

Sincerely yours
Vivian Justin Yak
