FEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HOUSING
OBALENDE-IKOYI LAGOS.
FROM:  ALFRED DOTUN

ASSISTANCE REQUIRED FOR TRANSFER OF US$25M AND  ACQUISITION OF PROPERTIES (REAL ESTATES]
Dear sir,
  I am making this contact with you on behalf of my colleagues. I am a member of the TENDER BOARD COMMITTEE of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing of Lagos Nigeria. Our duties includes: award, evaluation and review of contracts.

In 1996, my committee (TBC) awarded a contract of US$150,000,000 (One Hundred and Fifty Million United States Dollars
only) to a joint venture of SPEIBATIGNOLES and FOUGEROLLE, for an engineering, procurement,construction of pipeline network a Eleme Petro-Chemical plant. As it were, the acuta contract
sum was deliberately over-invoiced by us (TBC) with the sum of US$25,000,000.00 (TWENTY-FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY). The project was executed, commissioned and the contractor(s) paid accordingly.
My colleagues and I want to transfer the over-invoiced amount into a viable foreign account.

We have therefore resolved that as long as you can act as the sole beneficiary of the fund. The following will be the mode of sharing: 25% (i.e US$6.25M) for beneficiary i.e. owner of account, 10% for expenses incurred during the course of transfer, and 65% for us the officials. Let me reiterate at this juncture, that
there are top and influential government officials involved in this transfer and as such I would appreciate it, if this business is treated with utmost confidentiality. I do hope I can trust you as regards
this matter. In the light of this, I would like you to forward to me the following information:

1. Your company name and address if any
2. Your personal fax number
3. Your personal telephone number for easy communication.

This will enable us to forward the information to the Corporation for purposes of processing and immediate remittance of this funds to the account that will be provided by you.
All modalities have been worked out and the necessary machinery put in place with the officials of the Federal Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to effect this transfer within the
shortest possible time. It is worthy to note that this transaction is 100% risk free, my only fear is the confidentiality of this business from your end. It is pertinent to note that only an expatriate firm can lay
claim to this fund.

We are barred from operating foreign accounts as civil servants still serving the government. As soon as the payment is effected, and the amount mentioned above is successfully transferred
into your account, we intend to use own share in acquiring some properties (Real Estates) Abroad. For,this too, you shall also serve as our agent.
Please send your reply through this my email address.

I shall send you my phone number as we progress. Note that this E-mail is not one of those Internet jokes and should be treated with seriousness, utmost important and confidentiality. Your quick response
will be highly appreciated. If however, you are not disposed to assist, kindly destroy this letter, in view of the confidentiality of the proposed transaction and for the interest of the personalities
involved.
Best regards,
ALFRED DOTUN
