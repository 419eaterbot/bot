Hello Very Expensive (e)

I Mary Williams , a native of United Kingdom was born December 20, 1979 in
London residence in Accra, the economic capital of Ghana bordering the
Pacific Ocean.

My family and I had agreed by a lack of resources when I was a child. I
lost my parents at the age of 21. My husband died and I could not have
children with him.

My older brother was killed with his family in 2002 to the socio-political
crisis in Nigeria, and now I find myself today only, no children and no
family. I am of chemo and I am under medical supervision for more than two
(2) months here in Accra.

I have throat cancer; I am suffering terribly right now. My doctor just
informed me that my days are numbered seen my health is going from bad to
worse and I am condemned to certain death.

I would like to tell you a secret ... I could never tell someone. I have
exhausted all my savings for my medical care. But I still have money for a
charity project; these funds are registered in an account tax and stuck in
a local bank here in Ghana. For all financial transactions on the money I
must first unlock them. The direct release of the results of the funds
needed for immediate tax Ghana IRS that is truly enormous, which would
reduce by about half the capital.

My marital status is such that I am a widow, I lost my dear husband since
2003 years and unfortunately we have not had children together while I have
no one to bequeath my heritage. Therefore, for the release of my funds, I
would like to donate so it is not high on my taxes. So I graciously and to
help the poor said that you leave the legacy amounting to a value of 3.95
million Euros (=80 3.95 million) to help you create a charitable foundation
in my memory so God's grace be with me until my last home so I can receive
an honorable place with the Lord our Father.

The project I have in mind a long time and as often as they say money can
not buy happiness. At this point in my life I realize that money really can
not give me a healthy iron or buy a place in heaven. So I think it's time
to redeem myself with God in you bequeathed funds for the welfare of
others, because I will never be able to use it in this world of men.

I do not really afraid, because even before I put on my computer, I prayed
for several days and nights "Lord, I find my pleasure in thy will, I do not
forget your word lead me on it the way of thy commandments, for I myself
was pleased "For the Lord will give me the contact of a person of
confidence that I would give a result of what I'm doing research that
allowed me to contact you. So believe me you would let me live with the
eternal purpose that he was the one who led the meeting.

Can you keep half the money for you and the rest will be used to create a
charitable foundation in memory and a federation in the fight against
cancer and build orphanages for poor children. It is written in the Book
Matthew 7:7, that everything in his day: Ask and you shall receive, seek
and ye shall find, knock and the door will open. For everyone who asks
receives, who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it open.

I count on your goodwill, and I hope you open your heart for this gift.

Mary Williams
