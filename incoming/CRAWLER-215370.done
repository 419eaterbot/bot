Hello There!

This is a personal email directed to you. My wife and I won an Euro
Millions Jackpot Lottery of 101m million (Pounds) on October 11, 2011 and
have voluntarily decided
to donate the sum of 1,000,000.00 Pounds to you as part of our own
charity project to improve the lot of 20 lucky individuals all over the
world. If you have received
this email then you are one of the lucky recipients and all you have to do
is get back to us so that we can send your details to the payout bank.
