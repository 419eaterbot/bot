Greetings ,

I came across your contact on the web and I wish to use this  
opportunity to introduce to you a Funding Source that shares the  
desire to engage in the high-risk, high-return potential practice of  
?investment financing".

We provide capital to entrepreneurial companies and serious  
individuals who seek to make investments in the area of infrastructure  
and construction development such as Road &amp; Bridges Construction, Mega  
city development, alternative power, waste-management (waste to  
wealth), Real Estate, Oil, Mining, Trading etc anywhere in the world.

We have designated two categories for investors we seek to help  
finance their project ideas. (1) Type A (2) Type B.

Types (A) are investors whose project plan budget is between $100 to  
$50Billion USD

Types (B) are investors whose project plan budget is between $5 to  
$100million USD

If your venture idea fits into the above category and have solid  
background and idea of making good profit in any of the mentioned  
business or any other business in your country, please forward your  
profile to my email address:
