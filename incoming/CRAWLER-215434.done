Subject: THIS TRANSACTION IS STRICLY AND CONFIDENTIAL

I MR AHMED DIALLO, the director in charge of auditing and accounting section=
in Bank of Africa Ouagadougou Burkina Faso in west Africa with due respect=
and regards I have decided to contact you on this business transaction that=
will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction.

During my investigation and auditing in the bank, my department came across=
a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased customer, a foreigner who=
died on plain crash and, the fund has been dormant in his account with the=
bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or=
relation before my discovery to this development. Actually, the late=
customer was a big merchant who trades on Gold, Diamond, Elephant tusks and=
crude oil from Africa to Asia and Europe and this money he deposits in our=
bank to pay for his purchases.

Although personally, I kept this information secret within myself to enable=
the whole plans and idea be profitable and during the time of execution=
(Two is secret). The amount involved is $14 Million usd (Fourteen Million=
United States dollars).Meanwhile all the whole arrangement and directives=
needed to put claim over this fund as the bonfire next of kin to the=
deceased, will be forward to you upon your acceptance.

Information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and=
willingness to assist me and also benefit your self to this great business=
opportunity.

In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this=
country as a civil servant, we are not allowed to operate a foreign account=
and would eventually raise eye brow on my side during the time of transfer=
because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require=
a second party or fellow from a foreign nation who will forward claims as=
the next of kin with affidavit of trust of Oath to the bank and also=
present a foreign account where he will need the money to be retransferred=
into on his request as it may be, after due verification and clarification=
to designated bank account. I will not fail to inform you that this=
transaction is 100% risk free.

On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the=
total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of=
expenses that may arise during the time of transfer such as telephone bills=
etc, while 60% will be for me. Please, you have been advised to keep top=
secret as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after I=
have concluded this deal with you.

I will be monitoring the whole situation here in the bank until you confirm=
the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for=
subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously=
indicated and further investment, either in your country or any other=
country you may advise me to invest in. All other necessary information=
will be sent to you when I hear from you. I suggest you get back to me as=
soon as possible stating your wish in this deal and asking any questions=
that are not cleared by you for a good follow-up.
Please reply with the assurance, come up with the information's showed=
below:-

1)YOUR FULL NAME
2)YOUR AGE
3)MARITAL STATUS
4)YOUR CELL PHONE NUMBER
5)YOUR FAX NUMBER
6)YOUR COUNTRY
7)YOUR OCCUPATION
8)SEX
9)YOUR RELIGION
10)YOUR PRIVATE E-MAIL ADRESS

NOTE: THIS TRANSACTION IS STRICLY AND CONFIDENTIAL.
