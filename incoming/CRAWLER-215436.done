Greetings to you &amp; your Family,

Date: 17/02/2012

Good day friend,

I am Mr.Sani Butta I got your contact from the foreign affairs of Burkina-Faso. I need your assistance to transfer the sum of (usd7.2) seven million, two hundred thousand United States dollars into a foreign account.

This fund belonging to a deceased customer of this bank as the fund has been lying in a suspense account without anybody coming to put claim over the money since the account owner late Mr. Elian Diego who was involved in the died on march 11th 2004 at Madrid train attack, with his family during their vacation journey.

upon this discovery I decided to contact you so that the fund will be release to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety. the banking rules here on 5th January 2012 stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after one year, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund, since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.

Therefore, I am soliciting for your assistance to come forward as the next of kin. I have agreed that 40% of this money will be for you as the beneficiary respect of the provision of your account and service rendered, 55% will be for me while 5% will be for expenses incurred during the whole process of this transaction.

Then if the money transferred to your account from this bank, I will proceed immediately to your country for the sharing of the funds. I waited to hear from you as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Mr.Sani Butta.

Bank of Africa(Boa) Ouagadougou, Burkina-Faso.
