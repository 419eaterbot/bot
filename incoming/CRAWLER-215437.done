Compliment Of The  Season,

I Know That This Mail Will Come To You As A Surprise As We Never Meet
Before,When I Was Searching For A Foreign Partner I Assured Of Your Capability
And Reliability To Champion This Business Opportunity When I Prayed To God Or
Allah About You.In  My Department We Discovered An Abandoned Sum Of Five Million
Seven Hundred Thousand  United States Dollars($5.7M) . In An Account That
Belongs To One Of Our Foreign Customer (Mr.Salla Khatif) Who Died Along With His
Entire Family On (Monday, 1 June 2009) This Is The Plane Crash Web Site:(
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8076848.stm ) In A Plane Crash. Since We Got
Information About His Death,

We Have Been Expecting His Next Of Kin To Come Over And Claim His Money Because
We Cannot Release It Unless Somebody Applies For It As Next Of Kin Or Relation
To The Deceased As Indicated In Our Banking Guidelines, But Unfortunately We
Learnt That All His Supposed Next Of Kin Or Relation Died Alongside With Him At
The Plane Crash Leaving Nobody Behind For The Claim. It Is Therefore Upon This
Discovery That I And One Official In My Department Now Decided To Make This
Business Proposal To You And Release The Money To You As The Next Of Kin Or
Relation To The Deceased For Safety And Subsequent Disbursement Since Nobody Is
Coming For It And We Dont Want This Money To Go Into The Bank Treasury As
Unclaimed Bill. The Banking Law And Guideline Here Stipulates That If Such Money
Remained Unclamed After Five Years,

The Money Will Be Transfered Into The Bank Treasury As Unclaimed Fund. The
Request Of Foreigner As Next Of Kin In This Business Is Occasioned By The fact
That The Customer Was A Foreigner, And A Burkinabe Cannot Stand As Next Of Kin
To A Foreigner. We Agree That 45% Of This Money Will Be For You As Foreign
Partner, In Respect To The Provision Of A Foreign Account, 10 % Will Be Set
Aside For Expenses Incured During The Business And 45 % Would Be For Me,
Therefore After I And My Family Will Visit You In Your Country For Disbursement
According To The Percentages Indicated.

Therefore To Enable The Immediate Trnansfer Of This Fund To You As Arranged, You
Must Apply First To The Bank As Relations Or Next Of Kin Of The Deceased
Indicating Your Bank Name, Your Bank Account Number, Your Private Telephone And
Fax Number For Easy And Effective Communication And Location Where The Money
Will Be Remitted. Upon Receipt Of Your Reply, I Will Send To You By Fax Or Email
The Text Of The Application I Will Not Fail To Bring To Your Notice That This
Transaction Is Hitch Free And That You Should Not Entertain Any Atom Of Fear As
All Required Arrangements Have Been Made For The Transfer.
