Subject: From Faazila Justin

My Dearest one,

Hi, My name is Faazila Justin Yak, 23years old originated from Sudan. I
decide to contact you after my prayers, I really want to have a good
relationship with you. My father Dr. Justin Yak was the former
Minister for SPLA Affairs and Special Adviser to President Salva Kiir
of South Sudan for Decentralization. My father Dr.Justin Yak and my
mother including other top Military officers and top goverment
officials had been on board when the plane crashed on Friday May 02,
2008.
You can read more about the crash through the below site:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7380412.stm

After the burial of my father, my uncle conspired and sold my father's
properties to a Chinease Expatriate and live nothing for me. On a
faithful morning, I opened my father's briefcase and found out the
documents which he have deposited huge amount of money in one bank in
Burkina Faso with my name as the next of kin. I traveled to Burkina
Faso to withdraw the money so that I can start a better life and take
care of myself. On my arrival, the Branch manager of the Bank whom I
met in person told me that my father's instruction to the bank was the
money be release to me only when I am married or present a trustee who
will help me and invest the money overseas.

I have chosen to contact you after my prayers and I believe that you
will not betray my trust. But rather take me as your own sister.
Though you may wonder why I am so soon revealing myself to you without
knowing you, well, I will say that my mind convinced me that you are
the true person to help me. More so, I will like to disclose much to
you if you can help me to relocate to your country because my uncle
have threaten to assassinate me. The amount is $5.6 Million and I have
confirmed from the bank in Burkina Faso. You will also help me to
place the money in a more profitable business venture in your Country.

However, you will help by recommending a nice University in your
country so that I can complete my studies. It is my intention to
compensate you with 30% of the total money for your services and the
balance shall be my capital in your establishment. As soon as I
receive your interest in helping me, I will put things into action
immediately. In the light of the above, I shall appreciate an urgent
message indicating your ability and willingness to handle this
transaction sincerely. Please do keep this only to your self. I beg
you not to disclose it till i come over because I am affraid of my
wicked uncle who has threatened to kill me.

Sincerely yours,
Miss Faazila Justin Yak
