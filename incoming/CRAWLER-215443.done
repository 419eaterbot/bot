Subject: Hello This Message Is Respectfully Yours!

Hello This Message Is Respectfully Yours!

I am writing this mail to you with tears and sorrow from my heart. With due=
respect , trust and humanity, i appeal  to you to exercise a little patient=
and read through my letter, I wish to contact you personally for a long=
term  business relationship and investment assistance in your Country so i=
feel quite safe dealing with you in this  important business having gone=
through your remarkable profile, honestly' i got your profile in Google=
data base  when i was searching for a reliable person who could stand as my=
Trustee, i will really like to have a good  relationship with you and i=
have a special reason why i decided to contact you, i decided to contact=
you due to the  urgency of my situation, Nadia Kones is my name, a girl of=
23yrs of age, single and I held from Kenya in  East Africa. My father was=
the former Kenyan road Minister. He and Assistant Minister of Home Affairs=
Lorna  Laboso had been on board the Cessna 210, which was headed to Kericho=
and crashed in a remote area called  Kajong'a, in western Kenya. The plane=
crashed on the Tuesday 10th, June, 2008.

You can read more about the crash through the below site:
http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/06/10/kenya.crash/index.html

After the burial of my father, my stepmother and uncle conspired and sold my=
father's property to an Italian Expert  rate which the shared the money=
among themselves and live nothing for me. I am constrained to contact you =
because of the abuse I am receiving from my wicked stepmother and uncle.=
They planned to take away all my late  father's treasury and properties=
from me since the unexpected death of my beloved Father. Meanwhile i wanted=
to  escape to the USA but they hide away my international passport and=
other valuable traveling documents.Luckly hey  did not discover where i=
kept my fathers File which contains important documents. So I decided to=
run to the  refugee camp where i am presently seeking asylum under the=
United Nations High Commission for the Refugee  here in Ouagadougou,=
Republic of Burkina Faso.

One faithful morning, I opened my father's briefcase and found out the=
documents which he has deposited huge  amount of money in bank in Burkina=
Faso with my name as the next of kin. I traveled to Burkina Faso to=
withdraw  the money for a better life so that I can take care of myself and=
start a new life, on my arrival, the Bank Director  whom I met in person=
told me that my father's instruction/will to the bank is that the money=
would only be release  to me when I am married or present a trustee who=
will help me and invest the money overseas. I am in search of an  honest=
and reliable person who will help me and stand as my trustee so that I will=
present him to the Bank for  transfer of the money to his bank account=
overseas. I have chosen to contact you after my prayers and I believe  that=
you will not betray my trust. But rather take me as your own sister.

Although, you may wonder why I am so soon revealing myself to you without=
knowing you, well I will say that my  mind convinced me that you may be the=
true person to help me. Moreso, My father of blessed memory deposited  the=
sum of (US$5.800,000) Dollars in Bank with my name as the next of kin.=
However, I shall forward you with the  necessary documents on confirmation=
of your acceptance to assist me for the transfer and statement of the fund=
in  your country. As you will help me in an investment, and i will like to=
complete my studies, as i was in my 1year in  the university when my=
beloved father died. It is my intention to compensate you with 30% of the=
total money for  your services and the balance shall be my capital in your=
establishment. As soon as I receive your positive response  showing your=
interest I will put things into action immediately. In the light of the=
above. I shall appreciate an  urgent message indicating your ability and=
willingness to handle this transaction sincerely.

Awaiting your urgent and positive respond. Please do keep this only to your=
self for now until the bank will transfer  the fund. I beg you not to=
disclose it till i come over because I am afraid of my wicked stepmother=
who has  threatened to kill me and have the money alone ,I thank God Today=
that am out from my country (KENYA) but now  In (Burkina Faso) where my=
father deposited these money with my name as the next of Kin. I have the=
documents  for the claims.

Yours Sincerely
Miss Nadia  Kipkalya
