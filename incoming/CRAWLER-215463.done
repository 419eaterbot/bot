To whom it may concern,

I'm Mr. Terry Mark.
I choose to reach you through e-mail, as it is the fastest medium of  
communication irrespective of the fact that it has been greatly  
abused. I deem it necessary to introduce you to a lucrative business  
opportunity. I'm talking of crude oil trading! This is considered as  
the most legitimate and fastest money making machinery anyone can setup.

A crude oil lifting license gives the owner the mandate of the  
National Oil Company suppliers of the crude oil, to locate crude oil  
buyers and arrange a buy/sale crude oil transaction between the oil  
company and the crude oil buyers. The lifting license syndrome came  
into place because the national oil company does not deal directly  
with the buyers of the crude oil rather, they prefer to issue oil  
lifting license allocations to individuals/companies to assist them to  
market the crude oil which they produce. Anyone that owns an lifting  
license from the local National Oil Company is entitle to a $2.00  
commission from the oil company on each barrel of crude sold to the  
buyer and another $1.00 commission from the buyer. In total, oil  
lifting license owners receives a $3.00 commission on each barrel of  
crude sold by the oil company. Please note that the commission rates  
of $2.00 and $1.00 normally increases in times of crude oil scarcity.

The smallest license allocation/quantity one can procure from the  
National Oil Company is for the sale of 500,000 barrels of crude  
monthly/per transaction. This implies that 500,000 barrels of crude  
oil will be assigned to the license owner for sale per month. This  
allocation size will earn the license owner about $3.00 multiply by  
500,000 barrels which is $1.5 million gross commissions monthly. If  
one is lucky to secure a bigger allocation that means you will be  
earning more commissions monthly. These commissions will be calculated  
and paid to the license at the end of the sales transaction.

Currently a have an allocation for 2M Barrels of Bonny Light Crude Oil  
with all the documents intact, but my partner passed on, so we are  
saddled with the responsibility of finding a new partner who  
understands the business, ready and financially capable to charter a  
cargo for the lifting of the product and with an active bank account  
any where in the world to receive payments accrued from the sales of  
the product without any problems.

If you are interested and capable to partner with my company, please  
indicate interest by sending us your reply and your company details as  
I'm in Abuja Nigeria now to make changes in our contract with N.N.P.C.
You will also need to come to Nigeria for the signing of the contract  
otherwise you will need a service of a Nigerian indigenous lawyer who  
must be a senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN).

Yours sincerely,
Terry Mark.
