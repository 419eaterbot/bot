Hello Dear
How are you today i hope that everything is fine with you as it is my great
pleasure to reach you for communication. I saw your contact email while
making some research for reliable foreigner at (WEB) and i think we can
click and become Pen Pal friends.
Despite that we have not seen in person. I Hope we can make a good
friendship, because the best place to be is by the side of a good friend. I
believe that friendship is a gift that is fair in all things. It roots from
one's heart and involves memories that stay not for a while but for a
lifetime. " My heart welcomes you".
I will be very happy if you should write me back through my email in (
prcious_mabou12@yahoo.com ) for easy communication and to know all about
each other, I will send you my pictures and more details about me,
(Remember the distance,color or age  does not matter but our good heart and
sincerity matters in life). I will be waiting to hear from you i wish you
all the best for your day.  Always stay blessed from my deepest heart.
Yours Affectionately,
precious.
