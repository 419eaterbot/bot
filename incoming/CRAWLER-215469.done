Dear Friend,

You may be suprise to receive this mail since you don't know me personally, but with due respect, trust and humility, I write to you this proposal. I am Mr. Davies Rossman, the elder son of Hamas Rossman of Dafur Sudan. It is indeed my pleasure to contact you for assistance of a business venture which I intend to establish in your country.

I got your contact while I was doing a private research on the Internet for a reliable and capable foreign partner that will assist me and my family to transfer fund to his personal or private account for investment purpose Though I have not met with you before, but considering the recent political instabilities in my country, I believe one has to risk confiding in success sometimes in life. 

There is this huge amount of money (Fifteen Million U.S dollars) ($15,000,000.00) which my late Father deposited with a Financial Security Company in South Africa awaiting claim before he was assassinated by unknown persons during this war in Darfur Sudan.  Now I have decided to invest this money in your country or anywhere safe for security and political reasons. I want you to help me retrieve this money for onward transfer to any designated bank account of your choice for investment purposes on these areas below: 

1) Transport Industry 
2) Mechanized agriculture. 
3} Estate investment

We have to negotiate on what will be offered to you for assisting me to handle this project while 25% will be for you annually from the profit of the partnership company we are to establish .Please, read more on the news. www.savedarfur.org

All I require is your honest &amp; kind co-operation. I will give you further details as soon as you show interest in helping me.  

I wait for your kind consideration to my proposal.

Best Regards,

Mr. Davies Rossman
