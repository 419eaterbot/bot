Dear Friend,

How Are You Today

I am contacting you based on my desire to establish a mutually benefiting business relationship with you and consequently accomplish a certain business opportunity in Africa. I am Mr. Basil Samid, staff of Libyan national banking corporation, I am presently in London-UK due to the unrest in my country. I write you in respect of a customer of my bank Mallam Mohamed Kadir; who was killed by NATO air-strike attack in Libya, I was his account officer.

Before his death he completed a fund-transfer process of (USD 18.1m) to a west-African bank 'Intercontinental Bank' in Cotonou, Benin-Republic from our bank in Libya. As it stands, nobody will ever come for this money because he died with his family as his resident home was leveled by the air-strike. I write with intention to solicit your assistance to be presented as NEXT OF KIN to my Late Client to enable you lay claims on this inheritance and get this fund transferred into your nominated account. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you all will be well at the end of the day.

I want you to collaborate with me under a clear and legitimate agreement with you to safekeeping this money for further sharing between us. Services of a legal-attorney will be required to help legitimize your claims as the next of kin. However confidentiality and honest cooperation to enable us succeed is needed from you, we must ensure legitimate and timely transaction. I hope you read this proposal with good understanding of intent behind and please View this BBC web publication: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13843798

PLEASE YOU MAY CONTACT ME THROUGH MY PRIVATE EMAIL.
(mrbasilsamid2@hotmail.com)
Yours Faithfully,
Mr. Basil Samid
National Banking Corporation
