Subject: READ AND GET BACK TO ME

From The Desk of Madam.Arine Benson
Auditing manager African Development Bank(ADB)
Ouagadougou-Burkina faso
West Africa

Dear Friend,

I am Madam.Arine Benson,from Burkina faso in West Africa.I got your e-mail=
contacts from computerised datas after my extensive search via the website=
for a God-fearing and trust-worthy person to  bestow this transaction which=
is the only hope of our survival into his or her hands.When i got your=
address,I prayed and meditated fervently over it and i commited it into the=
hands of God, that you should be the rightful person to help us out before=
I made up my decision to contact you.I am The Manager of Auditing=
Department of Our Bank ,Ouagadougou Burkina Faso.  
In my department we discovered an abandoned usd$15M( fifteen  Million =
United States Dollars).
In an account that belongs to this our foreign customer who died along with=
his wife and and children in the plane crash.Since we got information about=
his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim=
his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as=
the next of kin or relation to the deceased, as indicated in our banking=
guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or=
relation died alongside with him in the plane crash leaving nobody behind=
for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I decided to make=
this business proposals to you and release the money to you as next of kin=
or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since=
nobody is coming for it because I don't want this money to go into the bank=
treasury as unclaimed Bill. 
The request of foreigner in this transaction is necessary because our late=
customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a=
foreigner,I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreigner=
partner in respect to the provision of a foreign account. 10% will be set=
aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60% would be for me ,=
after which I shall visit your country for disbursement according to the=
percentages indicated.  
Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as i have=
arranged,you will furnished me with a good receiving account details where=
the money will betransfered,your private tel and fax number for easy=
communication. 
Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or e-mail a text of=
the application which you shall retype and fax to our foreign remittance=
manager,for easy execution of the transaction.I will not fail to bring to=
your notice that this transaction is 100% hitch-free on both side. As all=
required arrangement have been made for the transfer and more so all the=
documents backing this claim will be supplied to you after you might have=
applied.
Please I would like you you keep this transaction confidential and as a top=
secret as you may wish to know that I am a senior Bank official.

Trusting to hear from you immediately.
Yours Sincerely,
Madam.Arine Benson
