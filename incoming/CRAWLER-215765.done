It has finally come to our notice that you have not claimed your winning price. We want to verify if truly you are the owner of the email address that has won the 2012 Apple email lottery. We already sent an email to your address notifying you about your winnings but unfortunately you did not write back.

If you are the owner of this email address that has won the Email lottery, we advice you claim your winning price as quick as possible to avoid loosing it, as the lottery program might come to an end next week.

Best Regards.
