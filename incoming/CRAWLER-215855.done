Attention to you,

It is with trust and sincerity that I approach you for assistance to transfer some funds into your bank account. Please do accept my apology if my mail infringes on your personal ethics. My names are Rotimi
Wright , a Private Lawyer based here in Johannesburg South Africa.

Honestly it will be my humble pleasure if we can work together. I would like you to act as the next of kin to my deceased client who made a deposit of $5.5 million only with a Bank here in Johannesburg few years back. He died in an Auto crash with his immediate family without any registered next of kin and as such the funds now have an open beneficiary mandate with a Bank, This means that any person from your country can act as the next of kin of the deceased person for claiming the inheritance funds without any risk involved.

More so, I have received official letter from the bank suggesting a likely proceeding for confiscation of the Fund in line with existing laws by the bank in which my client deposited the sum of $5.5 Million
Dollars. According to the Government Law as provided in section 129 sub 63(N), South African Banking Edit of 1981 at the expiration of 11 years the fund will revert to the ownership of the South African Government, if nobody applies to claim the fund.
My proposition to you is to present you to the bank as the Next of kin and beneficiary of my deceased client so that the bank will pay this $5.5 million to you so that we can share the amount on a mutually agreed percentage of 50% for me 50% for you. All legal documents to back up your claim as the deceased Next of Kin will be provided by me. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this transaction through. I guarantee you that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.

If you are interested in this transaction, kindly provide me with
YOUR FULL NAME
CONTACT ADDRESS
TELEPHONE AND FAX
Please do let me know immediately so that we can proceed.

Regards,
Barrister Rotimi Wright
