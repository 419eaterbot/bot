Note, this transaction is 100% risk free, there is no single risk connected to this business as I have worked out all modalities to complete the transaction successfully. Once the fund is released to you, we shall share in the ratio of 50% for me, 45% for you while remaining 5% for any expenses incurred during the cause of securing this deposit. If my proposal is acceptable to you, reply via my private email address: roberto_alonsochamber1@aol.com for further discussion on how to proceed.
