Dear Sir,
      RENAISSANCE PAYMENT OPTIONS.

We have received Instructions from the Financial Intellegence Unit of the
Federal Executive Council of the Republic of Nigeria

According to information at our disposal,your payment  was re validated
after the recent foreign debt reappraisal conducted by the  senate  in
conjunction with the International Monetary Fund{IMF}in which a debt buy
back agreement was reached by the government of Nigeria and our
establishment.

This resolution was made following series of allegations from foreign
beneficiaries that they had been swindled by some hoodlums of their hard
earned money running into thousands of dollars.

In effort to curtail this trend, it was resolved by the Federal Executive
Council to make your payment through a separate financial institution that
is not Central Bank of Nigeria because of some inherent financial
difficulties made possible by the statutory provision regulating the
functions of  Central Banks in matters of retail banking.

Our payment procedure will be through interswitch Multi-linked configured
Automated Teller Machine (ATM)Card System.The procedure involves loaded
ATM card in your favor which would enable you to access and discount your
funds through any ATM machine point any where in the world.

Our buy back arrangement with the Federal executive council and the IMF
entitle you to part payment{compensation} of the sum five million five
hundred thousand united states dollars{US$5,500,000.00} only via inter
switch ATM Card.

Consequently,We require you to confirm and forward all your necessary
personal detail and evidence of this payment claim to us to certify that
we have reached the bonafide beneficiary.
Warm regards,
Mr. Bright O Kep
