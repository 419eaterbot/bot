Goodday!!!

I have been waiting for you since to contact me for your Confirmable Bank
Draft of $800,000 United States Dollars, but I did not hear from you since
for a couple of weeks now. Then I went to the bank to confirm if the draft
has expired or getting near to expire and Dr.Wilson the Director Bank of
Africa told me that before the draft will get to your hand that it will
expire. So I told him to cash the $800,000 USD UNITED STATES DOLLARS to
cash payment to avoid losing this funds under expiration as I will be out
out of the country for a 5Months Course and I will not come back till
ending of June 2012.

What you have to do now is to contact ABLE COURIER COMPANY as soon as
possible to know when they will deliver your Consignment to you because of
the expiring date. For your information, I have paid for the delivering
Charge, Insurance premium.

The only money you will send to the ABLE COURIER COMPANY to deliver your
Consignment direct to your postal Address in your country is ($105.00 US)
One Hundred &amp; Five United States Dollars only being Security Keeping Fee of
the Courier Company so far.Again, don't be deceived by anybody to pay any
other money except $105.00 US Dollars. I would have paid that but they said
no because they don't know when you will contact them and in case of
demurrage.

You have to contact ABLE COURIER COMPANY now for the delivery of your
Draft with this information bellow;

Directors Name: Dr. Joseph Omega
Companys Name:ABLE COURIER COMPANY
Email Address: ( ablecouriercompany2009@gmail.com)
Tel/+229 98251280
FAX: 01987654098

Finally, make sure that you reconfirm your Postal address and Direct
telephone number to them again to avoid any mistake on the Delivery and ask
them to give you  your package number over there and know when it will get
to your address. Let me repeat again, try to contact them as soon as you
receive this mail to avoid any further delay and remember to pay them their
Security Keeping fee of $150.00 US Dollars for their immediate action.

Note this. The ABLE COURIER COMPANY don't know the contents of the Box. I
registered it as a BOX of Africa cloths. They did not know the contents was
money. this is to avoid them delaying with the BOX. Dont let them know
that box contents money ok and you have to try called the manager as soon
as you get this mail please.

I am waiting for your urgent response, And try to call Joseph Omega.

Yours Faithfully,
Mr. Mark Willams
