STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL              

Dear Sir/Madam, 

Compliments of the day to you and your family. I am writing to you with much respect and honour to this letter, which must remain private and confidential. I know my proposal will come to you as a surprise since you do not precisely know me. Anyway, my mind accepted you and I believe that this proposal will bring mutual benefit for both of us. 

Let me use this medium to introduce myself to you, I am MRS  CECELIA KAMOKAI  the wife of Alhaji Mustapha Kamokai, the former chairman of Diamond National Mining Co-operation and once the Director of Works and Housing before his untimely death. My Husband associated himself with coup plotters that ousted the government of Ahmed Tijan Kabbah on the 25th of May 1997 and was executed including ten (10) others. 

As a result of his death and uncontrollable war in my country, Sierra Leone, my children and I decided to seek asylum in South Africa where my Husband had deposited a Cash of US$12M (Twelve Million US Dollars Cash) and 1000 Carats of Rough Diamonds for us. We now want to use this money for investment in your country since we do not have anybody to assist us. 

Therefore, I am asking for your urgent assistance to forward this money into your country using very confidential and reliable means in which I will offer you 20% of the total amount for your king assistance.  

 However, This money and the Uncut Diamonds are safely kept in a Security Company before my husband death under disguise as precious items and nobody has any slight knowledge of what is inside the box deposited with the Security Company. In other words, there is no risk involved and so not hesitate to ask questions where necessary. 

All the documents covering the deposition of the money with the Security Company are intact with my son and me. 

Please your private phone and fax numbers will be mostly needed for easy and confidential communication, a copy of any valid Identity of your country and residential or office address.

We will sign a confidential agreement through my consultant on your arrival.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my private email address at ceckamokai@hotmail.com or Call my consultant Mr.Albert Ngume at: +27781792517 

Best regards, 
Mrs.Cecelia Kamokai 
For the family
