UNITED NATIONS OFFICE OF INTERNATIONAL OVERSIGHT SERVICES
Internal Audit,Monitoring,Consulting And Investigations Division

From: Mrs.Inga-Britt Ahlenius

Attention: Sir/Madam,

This is to inform you that I came to Nigeria yesterday from London, after
series of complains from the FBI and other Security agencies from Asia,
Europe, Oceania, Antarctica, South Erica and the United StatesofAmerica
respectively, against the Federal Government of Nigeria and the British
Government for he rate of scam activities going on in these two nations.

I have met with President Good luck Ebele Jonathan of Nigeria who claimed
that he has been trying his best to make sure you receive your fund in
your account.

Right now, as directed by our secretary general Mr. Ban Ki-Moon, We are
working in collaborations with the Nigerian Economic and Financial Crime
Commission (EFCC) and have decided to waive away all your clearance
fees/Charges and authorize the Government of Nigeria to effect the payment
of your compensation of an amount of $10M approved by both the British
government and the UN into your account without any delay. The only fee
you will pay to confirm your fund in your account is your Notarization fee
which will cost you only but $350, 00 united state dollars, to the UN.

Sincerely, you are a lucky person because I have just discovered that some
top Nigerian and British Government Officials are interested in your fund
and they are working in collaboration with One Mr. Richard Graves from USA
to frustrate you and thereafter divert your fund into their personal
account.

I have a very limited time to stay in Nigeria here so I would like you to
urgently respond to this message so that I can advise you on how best to
confirm your fund in your account within the next 72 hours. For oral
discussion, call me on this number which I just acquired in Nigeria today
+2347035513847.

Sincerely yours,
Mrs.Inga-Britt Ahlenius.
