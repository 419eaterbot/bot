Attention: Sir,


With due respect I crave your indulgence as Im contacting you in such a surprising manner, but I respectfully insist that you read this letter carefully and let me know your opinion or willingness in this business that I will propose to you.  This however is not mandatory nor will I in any manner compel you to honor it against your will, but I strongly believe that this business will open doors for unimaginable financial rewards for both of us, to be more precise, we both stand the chance of walking away with legacy worth of eighty four million Euros (Euros 84,000,000.00), so I hereby entreat you to lend me your sense of propriety, by reading this mail attentively.


In a brief introduction , my name are Dr. Akim Dantey, am the manager of Achieve Security Company Accra-Ghana, and I got your details from the Africa Union Daily data-base assessment/transaction here in Accra, and I deemed it very fit to contact you for the conclusion of  this honorable  transaction.


However, am mailing you simply because of two trunk boxes that has been deposited with my company by one of our numerous customers, who is demised (dead), for over six (6) years now, he deposited this boxes without introducing a next of kin, rather, the boxes are deposited in his own name, and in cases like this when the depositor does not introduce a next of kin, the Certificate of Deposit, and the Ownership Certificate, will be left with the management of my company.  My brother, I have used my offices to network this boxes in the name of my former partner, and his name is (Mr. Paul Smith), a British American citizen we where both paying the outstanding storage fee gradually hoping that we can finalize the payment before on the March 30th 2012, to my greatest surprise I called yesterday afternoon, and his wife told me he is demised (dead), though he is a 83old man. So what I need from you is your support and commitment so that we can both get these boxes out before the stipulated audition date. Please read the below mails attentively so you would understand me properly, and also be well abreast of the details of what we stand to benefit.


I apologize if I may sound too pompous, but I have been managing this security company for more than 15-yrs now, there is little I have not seen or experienced. Im doing this business with you because I do enjoy the international flare of it, income is merely a side benefit to having fun dealing with one another, this security company business is set on such a true course and natural flow, that if you know what you are doing, know the respective laws, follow the procedure protocol, and regulation laid down for your benefit, your success is all but guaranteed. My brother, please just let your enthusiasm be ignited so that we can get this boxes out before the stipulated audition date.

However, I want to seize this opportunity to reveal the major ethics of Security Company Management in order for you to be rest assured that you are dealing with a competent hand.


 a) We have what we call ordinary deposit

  b)   and insurance added value deposit.


When you are making an ordinary deposit the security company management, have no right to review the content of what you are depositing. But when an insurance value is to be added to your valuable you are depositing, the security company management, and the insurance company adding the value will have to review the box or boxes, and it's the worth of the content that will be calculated before the value will be added. And as the manager of this company I was privileged to represent my company when the insurance value was to be added to these two boxes.


Below you will find the breakdown of the content of the aforementioned boxes, just want you to know what we both stand to benefit.


Approximate kilo of gold is five hundred and fifty (550), kilos and per kilo price was calculated at    seventeen thousand five hundred dollars, (17, 500, 00), per kilo price, and the total five hundred fifty (550), kilos of gold amount to (USD$ 9, 625, 000, 00).The diamond carats is 7,044, in different carat weight and sizes, collectively we have weight sizes of 5.2  carat sizes, 7,21 and 8.15 this is in various size and in total the carats are 7,044 carat respectively, and the total breakdown is calculated at USD$2,857,00,00 per carat. And the total diamond, wish amount to (USD$ 20, 124, 708, 00). And the precious stone GREEN/EMERALD TOURMALINE with Vvs Clarity the sizes of the stones range from (2), two grams sizes to 5.5 sizes. The BLUE/GREEN TOURMALINE, with Vvs Clarity and sizes ranges from (2) two grams sizes to 4.5 grams, is worth (USD$ 3, 250, 202, 00)


The content in the other boxes contains (US$51, 000,000, 00), fifty one million Dollars, the insurance value was added in Euros, because of the unstable price of gold and diamond in the international market. The problem am having now is the balance of the outstanding storage fee because me and my former partner has paid 46thousand dollars, and the balance of the storage fee is Twelve thousand five hundred dollars (US$12,500), am in contact with you to see if you will be able to assist with the payment, because my company network will be audited on the March 30th 2012, and its imperative we get the boxes out before stipulated date? You will take 20% and I will take 40%, and we will give the balance 30% to the family of my former partner, and the balance 10% will be given to charity organization.


I guarantee that this will be executed under legitimate arrangement that will protect us from the breach of the law. But the most important part is that you honor the confidentiality. Upon receipt of your positive response I shall then furnish you with every necessary document with regards to this transaction.


Your earliest response to this mail will be highly appreciated.  For further detail please call (00233)-265-616-293.


l must not forget to wish you and your family a blissful weekend.

Dr. Akim Dantey.
