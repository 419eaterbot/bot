Due to security reasons I write to notify you of a confidential fund matter, I attached this information so that it can get across to you.
Ensure you rad it and respond ASAP.

                                                      Bank of East Asia Ltd.
                                                        Bank of East Asia Building,
                                                      137 Market Street, Singapore. 

Dear Friend,

My name is Mr Richard Boom. I trained and work as an external auditor for Bank of East Asia Ltd (BEA) Singapore. I Work as part of a bigger team that covers the entire Asian region. I have taken pains to find your contact through personal endeavours.

On routine audit check last month, I discovered some investment accounts that have been dormant for the last fourteen (14) years, all the accounts belonging to a single holder with monies totalling a little above (41,100,000.00) Forty-one Million One Hundred Thousand United States Dollars. Banking regulation in Singapore demands that the fiscal authorities are notified when accounts are dormant for this period, so that the funds can be called in by the regulatory bodies. The above set of facts underscores my reason of writing and making the following proposal. 

My investigations of the said account reveals that the investor died in 1997the exact time the account was last operated, I can confirm with certainty that the said investor died intestate and no nextofkin has been found or has come forward all these years. I am of the settled conviction that using my insider leverage and working with you, we can secure the funds instead of allowing it pass as an unclaimed fund into the coffers of the Singapore Government. This is especially possible as In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. 

In the field of Offshore banking, opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin. Offshore Banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; the deceased died intestate. In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate. 

This investigation has for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with your details as a possible relative of the deceased. My official capacity dictates that my department supervises the eventual outcome of the investigation.You had unfortunately declared that you are in no way affiliated with this individual. What this means, you being the last batch of names we had considered, is that our dear late fellow died with no known or identifiable family member. This leaves you as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit, and can stand as his extended relative. This exactly is why I crave your participation and co-operation.

I have seized all relevant documents (Legal and Banking) including access to the very account of the deceased. This will facilitate my putting you forward as the claimant/beneficiary of the funds and ultimately transfer the money to any account nominated by you. You shall be rewarded for your part in this transaction with 40% of the total funds for your efforts, less any expenses. I shall however leave out the final details of this transaction till I receive an affirmation of your desire to participate. Be assured that I am on top of the situation. There will be no risk involved whatsoever if you agree to come on board. Needless to say, UTMOST CONFIDENTIALITY is of vital importance if we are to successfully reap the immense benefits of this transaction. I guarantee that the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect us from any breach of law. 

To affirm your willingness and cooperation to my proposal please contact me through fax, or email stating the followings:-
(1) Full Name; (2) Telephone, Fax and Mobile Numbers; (3) Postal Address: (4) Occupation; 

Your prompt response will be highly appreciated. Please reply to my private email address: 
Kind Regards, 
Mr. Richard Boom
