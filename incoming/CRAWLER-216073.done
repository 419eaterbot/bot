Greetings to you,

This is just a short true note about your unpaid fund, therefore, you
need to relax and read very well to your best understanding.

I am Mr. Tony Albert. A computer scientist hired from Germany to work
with central bank of Nigeria because of my ability to operate
computerized activities. I am 25 years old, just started working with
C.B.N. I came across your file which was marked 'X' and your released
disk painted RED, I took time to study it and found out that you have
paid VIRTUALLY all fees but the fund was not released to you.

The most annoying thing is that they won't tell you the truth that on
no account will they ever release the fund to you, instead they allow
you spend money unnecessarily, I do not intend to work here all the
days of my life, I can make the funds be released to you if you can
certify me of my security and assure me that when I make the release,
you will settle me.

I needed to do this because you need to know the status of your Funds
and cause for the delay as well being in your shoe, Please this is
like a Mafia setting in Nigeria, you may not understand it because you
are not a Nigerian or you might not have been to Nigeria. The only
thing needed to release this fund is the Original Anti drug/terrorist
clearance certificate which will be tendered to any of your nominated
bank and the INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) for clearance of the
transferred amount in your account. I also understand that many of
these Mafias might have told you to pay for such before which you
might be thinking that it is the original you are paying for, but I
must assure you that the only person who is in the position to give
you the original is in the Federal Ministry of Finance.

Once the Original Anti drug /terrorist clearance certificate is
obtained funds will immediately reflect in your bank within 24 Hours,
the certificate is all that is needed to complete this transaction.

The only authorized person who will issue you your Original document
from the Federal Ministry of Finance is

Honorable                     Njoku
Phone number is          +234 8076563165
E-mail                          honorablenjoku@yahoo.com
Subject                        File Marked "X" Release Disk Painted RED.


Before you contact him, I want you to know that you cannot get the
certificate for free, as he will not even want to give you but if you
indicate your file to him in good faith, he will understand because he
is a God fearing person who has Human sympathy. and the cost of
purchase is $550.00 only (NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY UNITED STATES
DOLLARS ONLY)

Please Note: when contacting him, do not/ never tell him I was the
one, just make sure you indicate your file letter X and tell him
painted colour Red so that he would recognize your file.

Note that the actual funds is valued at $75,000 USD and the president
made a compensation fund release for all unpaid beneficiaries valued
at $5 million USD.

Therefore, you will not be able to receive your Original initial fund
but the sum of $4 million will be transferred to you as soon as the
original documents is cleared and every two weeks after the first four
million had been paid to you, they will make deposit of 1 million into
your account every two weeks but the important thing is to get the
Certificate and the first four Million.
