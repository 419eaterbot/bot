FYI

I have been waiting for you to pick up your Cashier Check of $800,000.00 USD (EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS) before I leave the Federal Republic of Nigeria, but you did not show up as I did not hear from you. I am writing to inform you that I have deposited your cashier check with High-Speed Delivery Service there in Nigeria.

For your information, I'm now in Malaysia to resume my new job offer and will not go back to Nigeria till next year. Please you have to contact the High-Speed Delivery Service of Nigeria to know when they will deliver your package to your resident address in your country.

Note that I have paid for the security keeping fee. The only money you will have to pay is the shipping/handling fee which only cost $80.00 US Dollars to receive your check parcel as agreed with them. 

Please contact the company with their below details:
