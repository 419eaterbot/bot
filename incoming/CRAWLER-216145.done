FROM: MRS GRACE/MICHAEL PAKER 
NO55 High land north, Johannesburg South Africa
Tel: + 27 78 588 1015 / Fax line:     +27 78 588 1015
                                                     Confidential Business Relationship. 
Attn: MD/C.E.O,

With respect, and humility am writing you this proposal letter which I hope may be of interest to you. There is nothing better for the spirit or the body than comfort of another and it elevates .We seeks the help of another, someone to share and share the life we live. I am the only Son of late Mr. Johnson Nkosi Paker who was murdered by the Zimbabwean veterans and irate black people along with other members of the family. 

I am probably of the view that you are aware of the present situation in my country Zimbabwe sequel to the Land/Farm reform Act crisis in Zimbabwe. Before the death of my Father on the 2nd of February 2006, he was a Prosperous Tobacco farmer and the Former President of the Commercial Farmers Union and one of the Major Sponsor of the Opposition Party Movement For Democratic Change (MDC) in Zimbabwe I am writing to you together with my family presently in South Africa where we have taken refugee.

I got your contact from South African Information Exchange online directory service and decided to this write letter for your assistance. I write to solicit for your special assistance to invest our Family fund in your country through your assistance in view of the existing peace in your country. Before the death of my Father and the consistent threats to his life because of his outstanding and vocal position against the government of President Robert Mugabe, He moved out the sum of US$21.5Million, (Twenty One Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars), to South Africa since it is the nearest neighboring country and deposited it with a security and Trust Firm company. 

Since the death of my husband, there have been threat to our life, but I and my Mother Grace Paker succeeded to work for our escape to South Africa as a political asylum seeker since that was the only option left for my family. In view of this development, our position in South Africa do not permit us to normalize this fund for any meaningful business transaction in South Africa since we live in South Africa on a refugee status, and the financial policies of this country do not permit us, we are soliciting for your help as a foreign partner. That is why I want this fund to be transferred into your Nominated account so that you will assist me to invest it in your country in any meaningful business venture. 

 Hence, if you agree to assist us, we have two options for you, we can go into partnership with you and your family the moment this fund is moved or transferred out of South Africa or in the alternative, we offer you 25% of the money for your assistance, 5% will be for the possible expenses incurred in the process of this transaction, while 70% will be for our family investment in your country, through your assistance. 

I want you to understand that this fund is purely a family/Tobacco fund/money.  Money made after years of our family investment in farming but we will appreciate it if you will maintain a high level of confidentiality because I and my family do not want to be traced by the agents of the ruling party where we are staying presently.  If you are interested in assisting us, kindly contact us with the above Telephone Number or Email address us so that we can discuss further on the process to facilitate the movement of this fund. Please, endeavor to call my son as soon as you send email, we need urgent and confidential response. 

Best Regards, 

MRS. MICHEAL/GRACE SHAROON PAKER,
(FOR THE FAMILY)
