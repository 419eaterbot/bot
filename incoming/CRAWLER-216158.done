HELLO, PLS KINDLY REPLY,

With warm heart I offer my friendship and greetings, and I hope this mail meets you in good time. However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past. I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit.

I am from Abidjan the economic capital city of Cote D'Ivoire the largest Cocoa producing nation in Africa.
The source through which I got your contact gave me the confidence to contact you for your kind assistance to help us to transfer and secure the US$ 12.5 M (Twelve Million, Five Hundred thousand US Dollars) I inherited from my late father, for investment in your country. My late father was a wealthy Agricultural Business man of Cocoa and Gold here in my country, before his tragic death, he told me about this money and handed me the deposit documents because our mother died many years ago.

I want to invest this money in your country been peaceful with your honest person and kind assistance And with your experience i think you are in a good position to assist me. And to make arrangement for us to come over to your country with my only younger sister to further our education after the transfer of the money to you as our guardian.

I am just 21 years old and university undergraduate with my little sister, and really don't know what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of the political crisis here and the death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life.
Pls Dear, I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards. Your suggestions and ideas will be highly appreciated.

Time is not on my side, We are willing to offer you 20% of the total money for your humble assistance. I will appreciate if you can get in touch with me as soon as you receive this letter so that i can give you more information about myself and my proposal and detail process.

Thanks and God bless, I'm looking forward to hear from you.

Best regards,

E. Dad.
