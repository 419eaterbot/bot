Good day,

Urgent/Confidential

This Is Very Urgent. I Have Seen Why You Have Not Been Paid. You Made The Mistake By Giving Them Money At First And They Will Keep Demanding Money From You On The Pretext Of One Documents Or The Other.

You Know How This Business Started And That Is The Way It Will End. Please Do Not Call Me On The Bank Telephone Line Except This Number I Have Given To You Above. If We Start, It Will Last For 4 Bank Working Days But Make Sure You Will Pull Out The Funds As Soon As It Hits Your Account.

This Is the Only Way Out, So let us Do It without Their Knowing and I Will Resign As Soon As You Confirm the Funds and Run Away.

Call me on receipt of this mail 234 802 899 1021.
