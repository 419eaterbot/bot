FROM THE DESK OF MR LAMIDOLAMIDO SANUSISANUSI
EXECUTIVE GOVERNOR, CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA (CBNCBN)
OUR REF: CBNCBN/OHGOHG/OXDOXD1/2012
YOUR REF:.................
TELEX: CENBANKCENBANK.
PAYMENT FILE: CBNCBN/BEN/010

                 CBNCBN DEBT PAYMENT NOTICE OF YOUR FUNDS

Attn: Beneficiary,

My name is Mr LamidoLamido SanusiSanusi  the Executive Governor Of The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBNCBN) and the Executive Chairman of "E.C.D.R".I discovered that your name and email address (in the Central Computer among the list of unpaid contractors, inheritance next of kin and lotto beneficiaries that was originated from Africa (Nigerian Government) Europe, Asia Plus Middle east, Americans) among the list of individuals and companies that your unpaid fund has been located to a suspense account.

Your name appeared among the beneficiaries who will receive a part-payment of $10 million and has been approved already for Payment. Yesterday two foreigners (Mr. Tim Parker and Mr. Rowland Gulf) visited my office in your stead to inform me that they are your Representatives from United State, whom you send to collecting your Funds for you.

We in this Bank do not understand why you sent these men to come and Collect your Funds on your behalf. If actually you want them to help you Collect your Inheritance Bill Sum,at least you should have informed me as the Executive Governor of this Bank. They actually tendered some Vital Documents which proved that you actually sent them for the Collection of these Funds. Honestly, it really baffles me that you took such decision without my consent.

Here are the Document which they tender to this Bank today:

  1. LETTER OF ADMINISTRATION.
 2. HIGH COURT INJUNCTION.
 3. ORDER TO RELEASE.

Actually, these Documents which they tendered to this Noble Bank is a clear Proof that you sent them to Collect this Funds for you. Finally, I told them to come back tomorrow morning and they promised to come back. As the Governor of this Noble Bank, I was supposed to Release this Funds to them but I refused to do so because I wanted to hear from you first.

Due to the Nature of my job, I will not want to make any mistake in Releasing this Funds to anyone except you whom is the Recognized BonafideBonafide Beneficiary to this Funds. Kindly clarify us on this issue before we make this Payment to these foreigners whom came on your behalf. In receipt of this confidential Letter, you are required to email this Bank immediately you receive this Confidential Letter.

OFFICIALLY SIGNED.
DR LAMIDOLAMIDO SANUSISANUSI.
GOVERNOR CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA
