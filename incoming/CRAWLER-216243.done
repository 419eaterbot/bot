YOUR URGENT REPLY SOON
Hello Dearest One,

How are you today, Please accept my sincere apologises if my email does not meet
your business or personal ethics, I really like to have a good relationship with
you, and I have a special reason why I decided to contact you because of the
urgency of my situation here.

Please I write not only to introduce myself to you, but also tender a joint
investment business proposal for your considerations and acceptance. I know that
receipt of my communication shall be a great surprise to you considering the
fact that we did not know each other or had any business negotiations before
now, I am also aware of the fact that there is a lot of fraudulent business
proposals circulating around the world, which makes it imperative for one to be
extremely careful before accepting and venturing any business proposal from
unfamiliar person like me.

I however, pray your respected self not to allow the above unnatural
abnormalities to influence your decision to accept my genuine proposal and
intentions which undoubtedly would be of immense mutual benefits to both of us.
I pledge to you for urgent and dedicated attention which this issue deserves.

I deem it necessary to introduce myself in detail for you and the need for your
assistance to claim and invest my inheritance for me, I am Miss. Isha Thomas D.
Voer Hanson, 26years old girl from Liberia, the only daughter of Late National
Bank of Liberia Governor, Thomas Hanson who died on June 8, 2009 at the Delaware
County Memorial Hospital in Upper Darby from a massive stroke. Meanwhile he had
earlier undergone a kidney transplant in april 2009 at the university hospital
of pennsylvania in philadelphia.

I am constrained to contact you because of the maltreatment I, am receiving from
my step mother. She planned to take away all my late father's treasury and
properties from me since the unexpected death of my beloved Father.

Meanwhile I wanted to escape to the Europe but they hide away my international
passport and other valuable traveling documents. Luckily they did not discover
where I kept my Father's File which contains important documents. So I decided
to run to the refugee camp where I am presently seeking asylum under the United
Nations High Commission for the Refugee here in Ouagadougou Republic of Burkina
Faso. I wish to contact you personally for a long term business relationship and
investment assistance in your country.

My father secretly deposited the sum of US$3,628, 000.00 in one of the prime
bank with my name as the next of kin. However, I shall forward you with the
necessary information of the deposit on confirmation of your acceptance to
assist me for the transfer and investment of the fund in your country. As you
will also help me in an investment, and I will like to complete my studies, as I
was in the school in Monrovia-Liberia, before the death of my father.

It is my intention to compensate you with 15% of the total money for your
services and the balance shall be my investment capital. This is the reason why
I decided to contact you. Please all communications should be through this email
address only for confidential purposes. As soon as I receive your positive
response showing your interest I will put things into action immediately. In the
light of the above, I shall appreciate an urgent message indicating your ability
and willingness to handle this transaction sincerely.

I am staying at the female hostel. Awaiting your urgent and positive response.
Please do keep this only to your self please I advice you not to disclose it to
a third party till I come over, once the fund has been transferred into your
account. I hope my explanation is very clear but if you need further
clarification, then send in your questions.I will try to scan my picture to send
in my next mail.

Thanks as I hope to receive from you soon.

Yours Sincerely
Miss Isha Thomas D. Voer Hanson
