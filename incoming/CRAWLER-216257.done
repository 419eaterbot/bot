Compliments of the day !

My name is Jack Herksfield, am 42, divorced but with a kid. I am the Director Of Operations in the management of Delta Delivery Services llc and i've worked with this Delta Company for a total of 15 years - from our Head office in Atlanta Georgia United States - down to our West-Africa office here in Accra Ghana. I really do not know you quite well but i just feel you and i can have this deal am about to propose and also get to know each other along but if on the contrary you don't buy the idea please do not reply and am not gonna write you again.

There's a trunk box which has been in our Company's storage room for more than ten (10) years now - nobody is asking after it and nobody has ever asked after it. This trunk box contains House documents (Documents for Duplex worth of $25,000,000.00-Twenty five million dollar) and cash money of $5.5 million dollar. My dear this is no joke. As it stands now, this box has only but (3) three months from now to get confiscated by our management if not claimed but the point is that the beneficiary is yet unknown while the depositor is no where to be found for more than ten years now.

Now as a staff in this management i can't directly claim this box and that's why am seeking a distinguished, trust worthy gentleman / lady who can stand and receive this box as the beneficiary for us to share the contents 50%:50%. Upon the receipt of your response i'll disclose to you the depositor's full information as tagged on this box and other relevant information. Believe me this deal is 100% real and risk-free, you really have nothing to worry about as I'll be here in our office to handle all the necessary paperwork in this deal together with my attorney who will secure a sworn affidavit of ownership on your behalf as a business partner and next of kin to the deceased depositor. 

All you need to do is to be brave-hearted to stand as the beneficiary and this once in a lifetime opportunity will be well used to achieve this great goal in this life. Think about it and get back to me ASAP and let's put this whole shebang in motion and i assure you that in (7) Seven working days we will get this deal done and smile together. Looking forward to receiving your kind response.

Jack Herksfield,
Director Of Operations,
D.D.S LLC Accra Ghana.
