This is a personal email directed to you. I am Dave Dawes, My Fiance and
I won a jackpot Lottery of 101 Million Great British Pounds which
equivalent to ($156 Million United State Dollars) in October, and have
voluntarily decided to donate the sum of 1 Million Great British Pounds
which is also equivalent ($1.56 Million United State Dollars) to you as
part of our own charity project to improve the lot of 5 unknown lucky
individuals all over the world plus 15 close friends and family. If you
have received this email then you are one of the lucky recipients and all
you have to do is get back with us so that we can send your details to the
payout bank.
