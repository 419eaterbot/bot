Hello,


Please, kindly take your time to understand the content of
this email. I wish to introduce you to a transaction that would be of 
immense benefit to both of us. Being an executor of wills, it is 
possible that we may be tempted to make fortune out of our client's 
situations, when we cannot help it, or left with no better option.



The
issue I am presenting to you is a case of my client who willed a 
fortune to his next-of-kin. It was most unfortunate that he and his 
next-of-kin died on the same day in an auto-crash few years ago. I am 
now faced with indecision about who to pass the fortune to. However, I 
don't belong to that school of thought which proposes that the fortune 
of unlucky people be given to the government. I therefore seek for your 
assistance in presenting you as next of Kin to the deceased so that you 
can inherit funds worth millions of dollars for our sharing.



Please
give your response to this email via return email. I will give you 
comprehensive details when I hear from you and how we can handle this 
together.



Regards,


Mr.Kazeem Ajani.
