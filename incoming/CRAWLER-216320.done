Dear sir,

RE: US$950,000.00 Compensation to your bank account.

We wish to congratulate and inform you that after thorough review of all unclaimed funds in conjunction with the World Bank and the United Nations Auditors report, your payment file has finally been forwarded to us for review and immediate payment of your long delayed funds starting with a first transfer of US$950,000.00 to your designated bank account in your country within the next 3 working days.

The audit reports shows that you have been going through hard times by paying a lot of money to some dubious officials for the release of your funds. We therefore advice that you stop further communication with any correspondence outside this office because you do not have to pay any money or fee to receive your funds.
