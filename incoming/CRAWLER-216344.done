Kindly View Attached Proposal 

From: Mr. Alan Mooki
Department of Energy &amp; Mineral Resources,  
Johannesburg, South Africa.
Tel: +27 73 9295995                                                          
Email: alan.mooki@gala.net

                                                 STRICTLY PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL

Attn: Sir/Madam,   

I write you this mail from my office in anticipation that you will understand and deem it strictly confidential for you personally. In this regard also, permit me to introduce my business proposal to you. My name is Mr. Alan Mooki; I am the Principal Accounting Officer, Department of Energy and Mineral Resources in my country, Republic of South Africa.

I therefore write to solicit your sincere co-operation in order to Redeem an investment interest currently being held under TRUST with the DEPARTMENT of ENERGY and MINERAL RESOURCES in First National Bank (FNB).The said investment which is now valued at (USD38.5M) THIRTY EIGHT MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS was originally purchased by Dr. George Brumley Jr, and leased in 1990 to EXXARO RESOURCES AND MINING CORPORATION. At maturity of the contract in May 2005, several efforts to contact DR. GEORGE BRAMLEY JR proved abortive. After further investigation from a close source, I was informed that DR. GEORGE BRAMLEY JR HAD PASSED AWAY. He died in Plane crash with the entire family, leaving no beneficiary to this fund. You can read the sad news at: http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/07/20/kenya.crash/index.html

Against this back drop, as the Head of accounts in the Department, I have, with my Director General (DG) carefully initiated the process of filing a claim for the money with the hope of having the Fund Transferred abroad for investment on our behalf since the original benefactor has died, we are hopeful you will agree with our intention to arrange payment of the claim in your NAME as the next of KIN to DR. GEORGE BRAMLEY JR. We require that you let us prepare and file the claim for the money from this Department indicating your name as the appointed beneficiary of the FUND. Upon approval of the payment of this claim, you will be paid THIRTY EIGHT MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS (USD38.5M).Moreover, since the money will be paid directly into a bank account to be nominated by you, you will have the responsibility to ensure that we receive our share of the money which I and my colleague have decided. All I require is your honest co-operation and I guarantee you that this transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement and no government involvement at all.

Lastly, bear in mind that this is a very safe and risk-free transaction as it is not prone to any enquiry since we are all active partners and will not want to lose our positions in Government and the Department. Meanwhile, I demand that you keep this transaction very Private and Confidential in view of our personal involvements. Should you accept to be part of this venture, kindly call or email me back with your full names, brief description of your business, your direct telephone and fax Numbers, and I will provide in detail about the processes for the claim
For your good cooperation, I propose offer you 30% of the total fund after the successful conclusion of this transaction.
I wait your urgent reply   

Kind Regards,
Mr. Alan Mooki
