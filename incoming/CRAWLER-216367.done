Dear Beloved.

I am Mrs. Mary Parker an aging widow suffering from long time illness. I have
some funds I inherited from my late husband, the sum of 7.5 Million  
Pounds and I
needed a very honest and God fearing Christian that will use the fund  
for God's
work, I found your email i decided to contact you. Please if you would be able
to use the funds for the Lord's work, kindly reply: marryparker52@gmail.com

Yours in the Lord,
Mrs. Mary Parker.
