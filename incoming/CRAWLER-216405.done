the opportunity of transfering a left over funds (US$10.5M) of one of my
bank clients who died along with his entire family in a plane crash.
Hence,I am inviting you for a business deal where this money can be
transferred out of the bank and shared between us in the ratio of 60% for
me and 40% for you.If you agree to my business proposal,further details of
the transfer will be forwarded to you as soon as i receive your return
email.

Sincerely,
