From Kabesala Monthantleh;

I am an executive of a bank. We have an account which has been left
dormant for nearly ten years now by a customer (a foreigner) who died long
ago without a next of kin. This account has a huge balance. With my
position and connection, legal papers can be arranged for you in your name
to claim the funds as next of kin.
You will be adequately rewarded for your role. Kindly let me have your
full contact details and telephone numbers so I can call you and explain
more details to you.
Regards,
Kabesala Monthantleh
