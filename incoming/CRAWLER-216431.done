Dear Sir/madam

My Name is Mr. Anthony Koman from Ivory Coast writing for investment purposes. I wish to invest in construction; hardware and other related industries in any part of the
Country that I may be asked to invest into in as much as the industry is lucrative. I
Also have an eye into fast -food franchising where there is an opportunity.
If there is any other area which you have interest for us to go into the
Industries as partners feel free to contact me for a discussion. Or you can
Give me your number to contact you

Thank you.

Yours faithfully

Anthony Koman.
