Dearest Beloved, 
Good day to you and.How is your health and family life going? hope this mail you are also  going to be reading is reaching you in good health condition, i am sorry to disturb your privacy at this moment, but i just found your email address now through my personal research from a email list. After finished reading your profile, and i felt deeply in my heart that you are that individual that i have been looking for and so i can contact you for a blessing that you are about to receive and also  share with people that need it ,my name is Mr. Ezra Nehemiah a  merchant from Dubai in the U.A.E. Living at the moment now in Ivory Coast in west Africa. I am 64 years old, never married, i  have no kids, i have been living all my life alone.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer .It has defile all forms  of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to  live, according to medical experts.I have not particularly lived my  life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself)but  my business. Though I am very rich, I was never Generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was  the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life  than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I  believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I  would live my life a different way from how i have lived it. Now that  God has called me,I have willed and given most of my property and  assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few  close friends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so,I  have decided to give alms to charity organizations through your  assistance of capability as i can not take up this challenge due to  the down fall of my present health conditions, as I want this to be  one of the last good deeds I do on earth. I want to believe that you  will be capable of handling this task for me.I will wait to hear from  you to know if you are capable of doing this favor for me, God will  bless you as you decide to do this I will wait for your urgent  response. Please add my e-mail address to your contact to directly receive my mails and write-ups.Otherwise, they could be treated as spams.
RegardsEzra Nehemiah
