Dear Friend

I hope my e-mail meets you well. I am in need of your assistance. My name is John England of the

Engineering Unit of US Military here in Baghdad in Iraq; we have about $30 Million US dollars that we want to move out of the country in three digital boxes. My partners and I need a good partner out there, someone we can trust to receive the funds on our behalf.

It is oil money and legal.

We have made arrangements with a Diplomatic Courier Service that will move the funds out of Iraq as a Family Treasures, also we have made arrangement to transfer the said fund through Bank of Baghdad depending on what you want, The most important thing is; Can

We Trust you once the funds get to you, simply take out 30% as your share and keep the remaining 70% for us. Your own part of this deal is to find a safe place where the funds can be sent to, ours is sending it to you safely.
