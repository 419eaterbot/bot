Dear Friend,

I write to seek your co-operation as my foreign partner and your assistance to enable us to own properties and invest in the economy of your country. I apologize if this letter does not suit your personal or business ethics.My name is Mr. Walter Sisulu, I work as the Foreign Operations Manager with a reputable bank here in Nigeria. I am making this venture proposal to you in strict confidence, although the world is very small place and hard place to meet people because you don't know who to trust or believe,but as I have developed the trust in you after my fasting and praying, i made up my mind to confide this confidential business suggestion to you.

There is an over due unclaimed sum of Twenty Nine Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars ($29,500,000.00) in my bank, belonging to one of our dead foreign customers. There were no beneficiaries stated concerning these funds. Therefore, your request as a foreigner is necessary to apply for the claim and release of the fund smoothly into your reliable bank account as the Foreign Business Partner to the deceased.

If you will like to work with me as a partner then indicate your interest after which we shall both discuss the modalities and the sharing percentage. All other information to facilitate the remittance of the funds will be revealed to you in due course. If you are not interested,please also indicate so, so that it will enable me to contact other foreign partners who might be interested to work with me.  I will appreciate if you could contact me through my direct email address: waltersisulu@rediffmail.com A swift acknowledgment of the receipt of this letter and early establishment of position will be appreciated.

Thank you and God bless you.
