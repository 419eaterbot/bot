Kind Attention Required.

I hereby write to enquire in confidence, That we can jointly do some genuine and legal stock transfer trading together based on a Joint Venture. I have an operative international certified acceptable Medium Term Note Stock (Program) le, which I was thinking I could work with you toreassign the account to your name, and I assume as so said of you to be Powerful in the financial, that after the reassignment, the amount would be transferred to your bank account.

The principal amount of the POF is US$350 Million, and I have already worked out modalities to execute the transfer successfully; hence I ask of you to confirm ASAP whether or not you are interested. The BOE is an irrevocable Bank Operative Instrument, which you can use as collateral to bank against a loan immediately we fully reassign to you, which means your bank can even borrow against it. I shall send you evidence of funds which once can still through bank-to-bank confirm Existence.

I would appreciate that you get back to me upon receipt of this important mail on your opinion towards a lasting business relationship.
