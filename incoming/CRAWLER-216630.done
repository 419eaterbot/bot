Request For assistance
Dear Friend,

I am compelled by my urgent need for a foreign partner that is why I have personally contacted you for this transaction. I am an auditor by profession working in Bank   of Africa, Burkina faso, West Africa. I have the opportunity of transfering a left over funds (US$10.5M) of one of my bank clients who died along with his entire family in a plane crash. Hence,I am inviting you for a business deal where this money can be transferred out of the bank and shared between us in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.If you agree to my business proposal,further details of the transfer will be forwarded to you as soon as i receive your return email.

Sincerely,
Dr.Ahmed Ali.
