Hello Dear,

Cordial Greetings to you. I am Mrs.Mariam OUEDRAOGO , I am presently working with the Bank Of Africa, here in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. I am sending you this brief mail just to seek your interest and honest partnership to transfer into your Bank Account the sum of Twenty Five Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars ($25,500,000), which was deposited in the Bank here by a Foreign customer before his accidental death some years ago. I will send you more details about this deal and the procedures to follow when I receive a positive response from you.

Best Regards,

Yours faithfully,
Mrs.Mariam OUEDRAOGO
