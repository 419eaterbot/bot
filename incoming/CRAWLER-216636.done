Good day,

warmest greetings to you. We know that our mail will be surprising to you since you do not know me and my brother, please, we are very sorry if we disturb your privacy. We really wish to contact you for a business venture which we intend to establish with you.

The reason why we have contacted you this way is because of the urgency needed and pressure which we are now facing to find some one to help us. Our Late father before he died deposited a huge amount Ten million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$10.5Million) in one of the leading bank here in Ouagadougou Burkina-Faso. I and my younger brother are looking for your help to guide us on how this money will be transferred abroad so that we can move out of here to continue our education in your country while you take charge of the investment with this money.

We are humbly seeking your godly assistance in the following ways; to provide an account into which this money would be transferred and to serve as a guardian of this money since we are Orphans and still very young.

If you can be of an assistance to us, we will be pleased to offer to you 30% of the total money. Please, we are waiting for your response urgently so that we can discuss more with you.

God Bless you abundantly

Yours Sincerely,
Miss. Sophia and David Tagro.
