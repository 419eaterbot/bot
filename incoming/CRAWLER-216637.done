Dear Friend,

I am contacting you to assist me in transferring the sum of $6,200,000.00
us dollars into your personal bank account, this will be for the benefit of
both of us.

This is a genuine business transaction only I cannot operate it alone
without using a Foreigner according to the laws guiding my bank, that is
why i am contacting you in this manner to help me stand before my bank as
the beneficiary to claim this fund into your bank account, for assisting me
to actualize this better opportunity, you will be entitled to have 30% from
the total fund while 70% will be for me, as a matter of fact, what i need
is your maximum cooperation and to provide a valid bank account where my
bank will transfer this money for the benefit of you and I. By indicating
your interest on assurance of trust I will send you the full details and
how this business will be executed.

Most importantly, please I will advice you to keep this business proposal
as a top secret between you and me. Or delete it immediately in your email
box if you are not interested in this fund transaction business. Your
urgent response to this mail will be highly appreciated.

Best regards,
Mrs. K Sabina.
