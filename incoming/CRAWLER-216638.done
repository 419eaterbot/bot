Hello,

With due respect to your person and much sincerity of purpose I make this contact with you as I believe that you can be of great assistance to me.I am Mr.Mahmadou Issa, from the Republic of BURKINA FASO,West Africa. Presently i work in the ministry of Works &amp; Housing,and i'm the secretary in charge of 'foreign contractors payment.And,I got your contact from the Burkina Faso 'online service' during my desperate search for a reliable and honest person.

I am contacting you to seek for your TRUST,assistance and possibly, partnership for investment purposes in your country.I have some funds to claim in my ministry with great caution,that were deposited in the Bank here, after the payment of completed contract projects to the foreign contractors (refurbishing,and installation of 40,000 housing units at Ouaga 2000), which will be of great benefit to both of us.Should you sincerely make up your mind to assist and also cooperate with me fully to actualize this dream;I promise, you will never regret knowing me.

To enable us discuss further on how you can fully render assistance kindly get back to me immediately with this private i.d ,for next step.

I am waiting,

Thank you for understanding,and anticipated cooperation.

Sincerely Yours,

Mr.Mahmadou Issa.
