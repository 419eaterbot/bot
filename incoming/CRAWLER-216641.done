PLEASE I NEED YOUR URGENT REPLY.

FROM THE DESK OF; MR JAVED GOGO,

AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING SECTION,

AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB),

OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO,

WEST AFRICA.                                                                


Dear friend,

I hope that you will not expose or betray the trust that I am about to impose on you. I decided to contact you to help me actualise this business for the mutual benefit of both our families. My name is Mr Javed Gogo, there is one of our customers who have made fixed deposit of 7 years and upon maturity; This is an unclaimed sum of Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars (US$10.5M) in my bank, I sent the notification to its address, but no response. After few months, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his business partner that he died after a brief illness in his country. We tried everything humanly possible to locate his relatives or family, but all efforts failed. The deposit is still intact with my bank and the interest is being paid into the principal sum at the end of each year.

If the fund remains in the account for more months, the fund will be confiscated and transferred into the treasury of the Government as unclaimed funds. This is why I contact you for joining hands with the honesty and truth to ensure that the fund is transferred into your bank account, a bank account anywhere in the world can help the transfer. All that is required of you is to contact my bank with the information I will send you as the next of kin or a business associate of the depositor with this system the fund will be paid into a bank account you will provide to the bank. To be honest with you, this is totally legal and 100% risk free.

But the secret must remain between you and me, I can assure you that I have work with this bank for many years and I know all the secrets and I have carefully mapped out my perfect strategies to handle this operation successfully. The depositor is my close friend before his death that is the main reason why I'm the only one working at the bank here that knows much about the existence of this fund and the secrets and the depositor. We will also use some part of the funds to help the orphanage and children less privileges in the world.


Hence you well be interested to assist me get this fund transferred in your account, I will reward you with 45 % of the total sum while 55% will be for me. If you are sure of your trust, integrity for safe-keeing this fund transferred in your account, contact me with your full detailed information including your private telephone number(mobile) for to guide you on the best legal way to tender an application to claim this fund successfully from our bank. Again my coming to your country once the money transferred we will exchange our photos, for you to know me in your country Airport, I am waiting for your urgent response.


Yours faithfully.
