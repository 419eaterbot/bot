Subject: Good day and compliments.

My Dearest,

  Good day to you, I have decided to contact you after much thought considering
the fact that we have not meet before, but because of the circumstance oblige
me, I decided to contact you due to the urgency of my present situation here in
the refugee camp, I am Miss Ajara  Kones, 25yrs old female and I from Kenya here
in Africa; my father was the former Kenyan road Minister. He and Assistant
Minister of Home Affairs Lorna Laboso had been on board the Cessna 210, which
was headed to Kericho and crashed in a remote area called Kajong'a, in western
Kenya. The plane crashed on Tuesday 10th, June, 2008. After the death of my
beloved father my wicked step mother along with my uncles team together and sold
everything that my late father had and share the money within themselves.
Unfortunately to me I fined my father's briefcase and when I opened it I found a
document, which my late father use to deposit the sum of Eight Million Five
Hundred Thousand United State Dollars ($8.500.000.00) in International Micro De
Finance Bank, here in Burkina Faso West Africa with my name as next of skin,
right now I am in Ouagadougou Capital of Burkina Faso to withdraw the money so
that i can start a better life and also further my education.


But on my arrival to the Bank, the Bank foreign Operation Department Director
whom I meet in person told me that my father instruction to their bank is that
the fund would only be release to me when I am married or present a
trustee/partner who will help me and invest the fund overseas after the
transfer, and the bank ask me to go and look for a foreign partner, that was why
I decided to contact you, which I believe that you are going to be honest and
reliable person that will help me and stand as my trustee/partner, so that I can
present you to the Bank for the release and transfer of the inheritance fund
into your bank account in your country, and It is my intention to compensate you
with 40% of the total fund for your services and help and the balance shall be
my capital in your establishment. As soon as I receive your positive response
showing your interest i will put things into action, in the light of the above,
I shall appreciate an urgent message indicating your ability and willingness to
handle this transaction, awaiting your urgent and positive response, Please do
keep this only to your self, i beg you not to disclose it to any body till i
come over because am afraid of my wicked stepmother, i will send you my picture
in my next email, with due respect, i am pleading that you help me, i am giving
all this detailed information with every transparency believing that you will
have a clear picture of the base of help i need from you.

I hope to hear from you soon, May truth and love be the guiding word in my refuge,

Best regard,

Yours Sincerely
