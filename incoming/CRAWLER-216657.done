Hello Consignment Owner,

I am Mr. Smith Carlson Scoth, Director Inspection Unit in John F.Kennedy International Airport NY USA; During our recent withheld 
package routine check at the Airport Storage Vault, we had discovered an abandoned shipment from one Diplomat agent called Frank 
Johnson who came all the way from Republic of Benin, under shipping forwarder from Hatfield-Jackson Atlanta Intl Airport to our facility 
custody here in JFK Intl Airport New York and when scanned, it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in one Metal Trunk Boxes weighing 
approximately 12kg.

The consignment was abandoned because the Contents of the consignment was not properly declared by the consignee as MONEY 
rather it was declared as personal effect to avoid diversion by the Shipping Agent and also the inability of the diplomat to pay for the 
United States Non Inspection Charges, On my assumption, the boxes contain more than $2.8 Million and the consignment is still in our 
Storage House here in NY Intl Airport till today.

However; You should be informed that the Consignment in one metal boxes with weight of about 12kg (Internal dimension: W61 x H156 x D73 (cm). 
Effective capacity: 180 L.) Approximately, the details of the consignment including your name/address and official document from the United Nations 
in Benin was tagged on the Metal Trunk boxes. Please note that this consignment is supposed to returned to the United States Treasury Department 
as unclaimed delivery due to your delays in contacting us with (Sworn Affidavit for claim / diplomatic immunity) from the origin of the Country Benin,

BOTH CERTIFICATES WILL COST YOU THE SUM OF 46 USD TO OBTAIN,

So as a matter of urgent you are hereby advised to pick up below information and send the Sworn Affidavit and diplomatic immunity fee of 46.00 to 
our Inspection Agent in Republic of Benin to obtain the Sworn Affidavit Certificate and diplomatic immunity from the Federal High Court of justice,

HERE IS THE INFORMATION WHERE TO SEND HIM THE 46 USD TODAY;

Receipt Name......Ameke Emmanuel
Country...............................Benin
Location..................... Cotonou
Text Question...............How
Answer...................... Long
Amount...................$46.00 usd

I await to hear from you urgently with the required fee.

THANK AND GOD BLESS.
