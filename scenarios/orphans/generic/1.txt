I just got back from vacation - I took some friends of mine on a really fun cruise around the Greek Islands. It was a very last-minute thing. My friends have been trying to get me out to have fun and it was something we planned at the last minute. 

Ok, first of all, how would you describe your perfect date. The more detailed your description, the better. I will give you a chance. Tell me all the details, young lady. Don't forget the details, like where we go, what we're wearing, and especially how the dates end...  Lol. 

Also, don't forget to send me a picutre and the poem. THANKS :)
