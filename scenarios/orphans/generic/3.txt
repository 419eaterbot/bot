I am thinking about buying an office building here in town and I spent my weekend working on the possible business deal. I plan on buying it and renting it out. I am really exciting - it looks like a good deal. 

I'm sorry - I am so bad with computers and email but I accidentally deleted your other email that had all the details. Can you send it again please?
