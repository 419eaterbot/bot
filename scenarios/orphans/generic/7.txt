Guess what? I wrote a poem about you! 

Look into my eyes - you will see 
What you mean to me 
Search your heart - search your soul 
And when you find me there you'll search no more 
Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for 
You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for 
You know it's true 
Everything I do - I do it for you 

Now it's your turn to write another one about me! I can't wait to hear it!
