I am very sorry to hear about your loss. Recently, I also lost someone that I cared deeply about, so I can relate to your pain. Whilst there is no cure for the loss of a family member, I believe that time heals all wounds. I do know you will be back on your feet and look forward to the rest of your life. Please be sure I will do my best to help you.
