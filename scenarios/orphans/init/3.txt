I would like to express my sincere condolences for your loss. News like that always bring us sorrow and heartbreak, but from experience I can tell you that time heals all wounds. Maybe in a few months, if not years, you will start to regain your joy in life and put the pain of your loss behind you. I'll do my best to help you through the process. It was not long ago, when I lost my dear mother. Please let me know what I can do to help you and I will do my best.
