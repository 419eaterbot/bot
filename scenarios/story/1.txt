Let me tell you a bit of a weird story from my past.

A few years ago a friend of mine unsuccessfully tried to kill himself by overdosing on pain pills. He was taken to a small hospital in Dover. I was living in Liverpool at the time so some friends as I drove down to check on him. When we made it down to the hospital we were asked to wait outside his room while a nurse was in the room attending to our friend. While we were standing in the hall a man dressed in coveralls walked up to us. He was obviously a mechanic by way of the oil stains on his coveralls and the strong smell of grease. We struck up a conversation with him and he told us he'd been down the street at the local mechanic shop (suspicions confirmed!) and he walked down to check on (what I now assumed to be) our mutual friend. He moved to walk into the room and we told him everyone was supposed to wait outside till the nurse was done in the room."Its okay" he says, pulling a stethoscope out of the pocket of his coveralls "I'm the Doctor".

Strange. Anything like that ever happen to you?
