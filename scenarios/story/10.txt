This happened to me the other day...

I went out cruising with a friend of mine and his friends. It was late, probably around 1am or so, and we were cruising down main street. Up ahead the traffic came to almost a crawl, this is weird since its late at night. We could see up ahead that there were 3 ford focuses all lined up and purposefully slowing traffic. My friends older brother, who was driving, hops in the median and guns it up to the focuses. We see that its just a bunch of kids getting their rocks off doing assholish things. The driver says "Oh Damn No!" He turns to my friend and says "You know what to do." He speeds ahead of the 3 focuses and pulls up on the side of the street. My friend grabs a cordless drill from the back of the Suburban (the vehicle we were in) jumps out of the vehicle and takes off the license plate. The focuses were past us at this point still going slow to piss off the people behind them. My friend gets back in the suburban and we take off! The driver speeds up to the focuses, gets in the median next to the far left focus, flips them off, then crashes his suburban into the focus which in turn crashes into the other focuses. At this point I am like, What did just happened?! We watch for a minute as we watch these kids trying to get over their airbags and start assessing the damage. Everyone in the vehicle is busting up laughing and we take off flying down main street. When we got back to my friends house he puts the license plate back on and pops the dent out of the suburban.
