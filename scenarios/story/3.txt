Let me tell you a story, perhaps you can help.

We have this local crazy lady... Everybody called her "Crazy Gina". Apparently at one time she was a normal person and had a family and everything, and then she started doing drugs and kind of lost it.

She had a garden in her front yard, which sounds normal... But she was "growing" rubber boots. She had planted like 20 or so rubber boots with just the tops hanging out. And she had another 30 or so just in a huge pile. It's been there for as long as I can remember.

She decided one day that she was going to paint her house, which again sounds kind of normal... Except instead of doing it like a normal person, she bought a can of spray paint. And instead of spray painting like a normal person to try to get even coverage, she just sprayed it all over... That led to more people going up to her house and spraying random things at it.

Then I guess she got tired of that so she ripped off like half of her siding. Not all of it, no. Just half. And she was the only person in the entire town to have bars on her windows.

And man, you ever walk down the street she lives on... Wow, she'd be yelling "Get the bloody hell away from my house!" and then you'd have to run away from her and everything. 

Anything like that ever happen to you?
