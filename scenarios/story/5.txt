Let me tell you what happened to me the other day!

I came home from work and walked into my apartment. I hear noises coming from my room but don't think anything of it because my cat is quite noisy. I get something from the fridge sit down and start watching T.V. Then I hear a sneeze. My brother isn't home. It came from my room. Huh.

I calmly walk into my room figuring it's his girlfriend or something and there is a dude rummaging through my closet. I freak out, grab a sword (not a lethal one even) that I had hanging on my wall and demanded he get the hell out of my house.

He turns around and is as shocked as I am grabs an axe (also not lethal) that was in the closet, I swing my sword at him trying to scare him, he does the same to me and we both kind of ran out of the apartment together and proceeded to basically have a catfight with weapons in the middle of my apartment complex's courtyard.

Turns out he lived next door and had some severe developmental disabilities. Thought he was in his house when he walked into mine (my brother forgot to lock the door) and was trying to figure out why everything was different. His caretaker came out and saw us being... well basically ridiculous and both freaking out and yelled at us. The volume of her voice was... epic. Ear shattering.

In the end we talked about it, I yelled at my brother for not locking the door, he promised to keep a better eye on her son and him and I write letters to each other now that we don't live next to each other.
