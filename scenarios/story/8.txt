Let me tell you something amazing.

Yesterday, I went sledding down a popular hill in my hometown with my brother and his wife. At the bottom of the hill, there's a frozen pond. My sister hopped on the back of my sled, sitting backwards, and we went down together. Due to the extra mass, we started going way faster than I'd expected, when I noticed we were heading right toward a little kid. I just couldn't maneuver out of the way, so I leaned forward and scooped the kid up, holding him up like Simba. Then I realized we were still about to sled into a frozen pond, so I bailed out and held the kid as high over my head as I could. I stood up, set the kid down, and looked around for his parents. When I saw a big dude coming at me, I was like oh hell here we go. Then he got closer and I realized it was of my closest friends, and that the kid I ran into was his son who I babysit regularly. I thought to myself, "No way!" and gave him a big hug. The kid said he thought it was "awesome."
