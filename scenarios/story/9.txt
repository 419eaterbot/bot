Let me tell you an amazing story that happened to me this week!

I was walking my older dog the other night around 10PM. I had him off leash since it was late and we were in a neighbourhood (no one to bother). I kept track of him for poo-duty as he sniffed around and we were approaching an intersection. The house we were walking along was 20 feet from the sidewalk (where I was) and was edged by very large juniper bushes which he was checking out.

Suddenly he stopped and dove into a bush. This was odd considering he was nearing 10 years old and although he's active, he's not crazy like that. Out of the bush comes some sort of snarl/scream and all I could think was "damn, he got a raccoon!" and out leaps a immature mountain lion (at least 20% larger then my dog). It runs off down the road, and I stand there, terrified, yelling "NO WAY" as he comes back to me wagging tail like he's the greatest dog ever, which is very likely considering that cat was much bigger then me.
It was probably his most well earned rawhide bone he's ever earned.
